Local performers ranging from rock bands and folk singers to Suzuki violin ensembles and jazz combos and beyond will take to the porches of Fall Creek for an afternoon celebrating Ithaca's wealth of local musical talent. Each year's Porchfest has been larger than the last, and 2013 will be no exception, with 139 performers signed up. See reverse for a list of artists confirmed for this year; the performance schedule will be announced soon.\n\nPorchfest will run from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with a picnic and open jam in Thompson Park (on Cayuga Street between Cascadilla and Marshall streets) to follow at 5:30 PM.\n\nThe number of Porchfest bands has increased steadily by about 20 performers per year since the first event in 2007. Organizers expect that there will be more than 150 bands signed up to play next year; in 2020 there will be 266 bands, and Porchfest will have exceeded 1000 bands in the year 2059. (The current committee is planning to retire before then.)\n\nAs in past years, local painter Nina Widger has created an original work for Porchfest 2013, which will be featured on Porchfest posters, t-shirts and other materials. This year's painting can be viewed on Porchfest's Facebook page, facebook.com/porchfest (direct link to photo: http://on.fb.me/1c73ZzL).\n\nSince the first Porchfest in 2007, the concept has spread widely, with at least 10 similar events launching from Belleville, Ontario, to Tucson, Arizona.\n\nPorchfest 2013 is sponsored by Ithaca Neighborhood Housing Services (ithacanhs.org), a non-profit, community development corporation whose mission is to revitalize Ithaca\u2019s neighborhoods, encouraging stability and diversity, and to help people of modest incomes obtain affordable housing on a long-term basis. Additional support for printed Porchfest maps comes from the Museum of the Earth, whose Dino Jam concert is scheduled for November 10 (www.museumoftheearth.org).\n\n# # #\n\nPORCHFEST 2013 PERFORMERS:\n\n18 Strings Of Luv\n5 Mile Drive\nThe Accords\nAlan Rose and the Restless Elements\nAndrew & Rose\nAnna Coogan's Vocal Studio\nAnswer the Muse\nAthena's Grove\nBadHand\nBand Name\nBanjo Rags\nBert Scholl & Friends\nBeverly Stokes\nBlack is Green\nBlue Skies\nBridgewater\nBurns and Kristy Band\nCap & Cady\nCats Elbow\nCharlie Young\nChattering Walnut\nChristopher Gerard Band\nCielle & All Sounds On\nCommons Crossing\nCornell Ukulele Club\nThe Creatures\nDancin Feldman\nDiamonds in the Rough\nDiana Leigh Trio\nDiwas Gurung\nDjug Django\nDoolin O'Dey\nThe Double E\nEdmund's Ivy\nEdukated Fleas\nEl Caminos\nEl Rumbon\nElla Sarachan\nephemera\nThe Fall Creek Bluegrass Partners\nFall Creek Folk\nFall Crikkers Jug Band\nThe Fauxs\nThe Fly Rods\nGadje\nGary and Leeann Reynolds: \"The old Reyns\"\nGeoclipse\nThe Geronimo Line\nThe Glacial Erotics\nGlendale Farm Band\nThe Go Cats\nGrassanova\nGrasskickers\nGrey Gary\nGrietzer Hodgson Manning\nThe Gunpoets\nThe Habits\nHalogen Sons\nHappy Hollow\nHarry Nichols Band\nHead Band\nThe Hilltoppers\nHome Grounds\nICO Brass Quintet\nImmortal Jellyfish\nIthaca Cats\nIthaca Gay Men's Chorus\nIthacan Songwriters Round\nThe JazzHappensBand\nJeannie Burns\nJennie Stearns\nJustin Zupnick & Friends\nKing Street Ramblers\nKites in Space\nLeah Houghtaling and Amelia Sauter\nLily and Matt\nLong John & the Tights\nLucky Old Sun\nMa'am Jam\nMad Cow Tippers\nMad Goat String Band\nMaplewood Jazz Team\nMary Bentley\nMel & Sol \nThe MonkeySquids\nMosaic Foundation\nMostly Mandolin Quartet\nThe Muckland Crooners\nNate & Kate\nNate and Friends\nThe Near Varna All-Stars\nThe Newman Bros.\nNone\nNot From Wisconsin\nOld Time Jam\nPatti Witten\nThe Pelotones\nPierce Walsh\nPolly Wood\nProfessor Tuesday's Jazz Quartet\nThe Purple Valley\nRed Sled Choir\nRegina O'Brien with Charles d'Orban\nRockwood Ferry Trio\nRottweiler Nation\nRune Hill Revival\nThe Rungs\nRyan B\nSamuel B.

Our faculty, students, and staff strive to provide quality medical care and education for our clients and their animal companions.\n\nIn the changing economic times, many of CUHA\u2019s clients have found it difficult to afford quality medical care for their animal companions, both large and small. These clients are forced to forgo necessary diagnostic procedures and life saving treatments for their animals. To assist clients and patients in need, CUHA has created the Patient Assistance Fund. The Patient Assistance Fund benefits our clients with economic need to help cover medical and surgical costs for their animal companions. We, the Student Chapter of the American Veterinary Medical Association (SCAVMA), have chosen to support the Patient Assistance Fund at CUHA with this year\u2019s Pedal for Pets bike-a-thon.\n\nWe invite you to join us! You can join our bikers on a 30- or 50-mile bike ride throughout Ithaca and the neighboring communities, sponsor a rider, donate a prize at the finish line for our riders, or help us to sponsor the event.

Emerging narratives about the Anthropocene mobilize ideas about the human, the person, and the body that often universalize rather than particularize, occluding the fact that, for example, in the Americas, access to these categorizations has long been shot through with histories of normative violence. In this talk I consider the ways that visible and less-than-visible violences continue to be visited upon Black bodies in this hemisphere. I ask: how might Black experience with perishment offer a rubric for thinking futurity, including reproductive futurity, in a moment of environmental collapse?

Tough Turtle is Ithaca\u2019s original  adventure obstacle course race, fostering team spirit, building community, and supporting a critical local cause: inspiring the next generation of environmental stewards. \n\nThe 5th annual Tough Turtle celebrates the milestone anniversary with a daring 10K option and even more unique and challenging obstacles. Also new this year is a finish line festival sponsored by CTB/Ithaca Bakery and Ithaca Beer, complete with exciting raffle prizes for our top FundRACER\u2019s, food and beverage, live entertainment, games, and more.\n\nAs always, the Tough Turtle course will be designed to challenge competitive thrill seekers, families, and participants of all ages and experience levels. Racers will climb, sprint, crawl, and slide through obstacle course along the Cayuga Waterfront and Black Diamond Trails on the south shore of Cayuga Lake.  Children not old enough to participate in the main Tough Turtle course will enjoy an equally thrilling and age-appropriate Tough Turtle Junior course, which does not require advance registration.\n\nThanks to our generous sponsors, every dollar raised through Tough Turtle registration and FundRACING goes directly to support ICG\u2019s mission of inspiring environmental stewardship. In fact, critical funds raised during Tough Turtle support direct programming that reaches 8,200 children and families annually, and keeps the Garden free and open to the 69,000 visitors each year!  \n\nTo register yourself or a team, sign up to volunteer, or learn about sponsorship opportunities, visit www.toughturtleithaca.com. \n\nEvent registration IS OPEN! Spaces are limited and this race fills up quickly.

This talk describes the rationale, design and results of two large school-randomized trials designed to improve both sets of outcomes. The first trial tests the efficacy of the 4Rs program in primary schools serving low-income African-American and Latino children in New York City. The second trial tests the efficacy of the OPEQ initiative (Opportunity for Equal Access to Quality Basic Education) in 144 primary schools in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Lessons learned to date and future opportunities and challenges raised by these efforts will be discussed.\n\nLawrence Aber is Distinguished Professor of Applied Psychology and Public Policy at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, New York University, where he also serves as board chair of its Institute of Human Development and Social Change.

Them\"\nhttp://events.cornell.edu/event/bctr_talks_at_twelve_andrew_jefferson\n\nVideo games are becoming increasingly pervasive in modern culture, generating excitement about their potential as educational tools. However, understanding how to productively use games as a tool for education and research can be difficult for those unfamiliar with the medium. In his talk, Andrew Jefferson will highlight the properties of video games as a medium that make them suited to education and research. He will explore these properties looking at both commercial games and academic interventions, with special attention to which advances in commercial game design are useful for educational and research projects. Finally, Mr. Jefferson will discuss the limitations of using these tools and lessons learned from previous failed projects.\n\nAndrew Jefferson is a fifth year doctoral candidate in Human Development in the College of Human Ecology. He received his MA from Cornell (2011) for work on scientific reasoning and how people change theories in response to new information, and a BS in Neuroscience from the College of William and Mary (2007). He is currently working on his dissertation project with the ASSET program (Assisting Secondary Science Education with Tetrahymena) and an interdisciplinary team to develop an educational game for high school biology students, and study its impact on reasoning, motivation, and behavior.\nLunch will be served.

Wendy will be speaking three times over the course of Shabbat: Friday night (after dinner with ABQ), Shabbat morning and Shabbat afternoon before mincha.  Sources in English will be available for all shiurim.  \n\nSchedule: \nFriday night after dinner (approx. 8:30) in 104 West!\n Elisha ben Abuyah: The High Road to Heresy\n\nDespite a promising start as a First Century Sage and Scholar, Elisha ben Abuyah leaves the path and becomes a notorious heretic. How did that happen? We will study an array of Rabbinic texts that seek to explain Elisha\u2019s apostasy and explore the potential reasons why a believer would lose faith.\n\nShabbat morning (approx. 11:45) in CJL Piano Room \nIdolizing Aharon\n\nHow can we reconcile the priestly, beneficent Aharon of the rest of the Torah with the Aharon who builds the golden calf in Parshat Ki-Tissa? We will explore Aharon\u2019s actions in Exodus 32 and the varying attempts of the midrash and of medieval exegetes to make sense of his behavior.\n\nShabbat afternoon 4:45 in 104 West!\nElisha and R. Meir: Tainted Torah?\n\nEven once Elisha ben Abuyah becomes a heretic, his student R. Meir continues to learn from him. Why does Meir persist in studying with Elisha? Why does Elisha keep teaching Meir? Does this relationship taint Rabbi Meir\u2019s Torah? We will explore their complicated relationship and examine the nature of pedagogic loyalties.\n\n\n\n\nThis event has been generously supported by the Institute for Jewish Ideas and Ideas, which offers a vision of Orthodox Judaism that is intellectually sound, spiritually compelling, and emotionally satisfying. Based on an unwavering commitment to the Torah tradition and to the Jewish people, it fosters an appreciation of legitimate diversity within Orthodoxy.\n\nFrom Drisha's website: Wendy Amsellem  teaches in the Yesodot Program and is the Director of the July Collegiate Program for Women at Drisha. She is the former Director of the Dr. Beth Samuels High School Program and an alumna of the Drisha Scholars Circle. She is pursuing a PhD in Judaic Studies at New York University and has a BA in History and Literature from Harvard University.

From that stage on, Mahi encountered an array of people \u2013 coaches, mentors, friends and even enemies \u2013 all of them who shaped the incredible journey of an ordinary teenager from a small town of eastern India to the most successful captain of team India. Dhoni's pride and respect for his nation was only mirrored in his commitment in never letting it down. M. S. Dhoni The Untold Story chronicles this untold journey \u2013 one which is shouldered with unflinching dedication through the years.

CU Prof Emeritus Tony Ingraffea (Civil & Environmental Engineering) will take questions following the screening, and may be joined by Prof Chuck Greene (Earth & Atmospheric Sciences) & Prof Bob Howarth (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). From Academy Award\u00ae-winning filmmaker Fisher Stevens, Before the Flood presents a riveting account of the dramatic changes now occurring around the world due to climate change, as well as the actions we as individuals and as a society can take to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet. The film follows DiCaprio as he travels to five continents and the Arctic speaking to scientists, world leaders, activists and local residents to gain a deeper understanding of this complex issue and investigate concrete solutions to the most pressing environmental challenge of our time. \"From the toxic tar sands of Alberta to the frequently flooded streets of Miami Beach, from the smog-choked avenues of Beijing to the incinerated forests of Indonesia, DiCaprio meets with scientists, politicians, and activists to face the facts: natural disasters are becoming more frequent, wildlife is vanishing, communities are being destroyed. What is to be done? This isn't the first environmental documentary and it won't be the last. But DiCaprio's charisma makes it one of the most accessible. His passion and inquisitiveness radiate in his blunt talk and genuine curiosity. He confesses to feelings of pessimism, but he receives motivating wisdom from luminaries including entrepreneur and inventor Elon Musk, meteorologist and astronaut Piers Sellers, activist and environmentalist Sunita Narain, and President of the United States Barack Obama. As it sweeps us along on its fascinating tour, Before the Flood reminds us of the beauty and diversity of our world. It also galvanizes us to do whatever it takes to save the planet \u2014 and ourselves.\" (Thom Powers, documentary programmer, Toronto Intntl Film Festival)", "start_time": "2016-10-20T16:45:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Cinema has been cited as one of the best campus film exhibition programs in the country, screening close to 150 different films/videos each year, five nights a week in the beautiful Willard Straight Theatre.", "name": "Cornell Cinema", "emails": null, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c24.0.200.200/p200x200/1175506_10153160570160529_509717013_n.jpg?oh=44ab5d49a650be63ad079b10cf2c0951&oe=595B4C39", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4860489, "state": "NY", "street": "104 Willard Straight Hall", "latitude": 42.4458606}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17499053_10158600398895529_2784605827420626821_n.jpg?oh=21fa50449d830dfeba28e6379799f6e5&oe=5963B7D6", "id": "215249100528"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c67.0.200.200/p200x200/14666253_10157677247060529_737817326395102251_n.jpg?oh=9c49fc92eb18e98920ab0e4915563ab3&oe=59993854", "end_time": "2016-10-20T18:20:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14666253_10157677247060529_737817326395102251_n.jpg?oh=92ce81bcb94613add7844a1e7be9e486&oe=599AF686", "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "1600881453539241", "name": "Before the Flood w/discussion - Free"}, {"category": "MOVIE_EVENT", "distance": 467.1798499484475, "stats": {"attending": 17, "noreply": 456, "declined": 0, "maybe": 69}, "description": "Citizen Koch-Mon,10.17, 6:45pm, w/filmmaker Tia Lessin; \nWhere to Invade Next-Tues,10.18, 7pm, w/producer Tia Lessin.\nTia Lessin Career Talk: Tues,10.18, 4:30-5:30pm, moderated by Prof Austin Bunn, Schwartz Center, Rm 124\nAcademy Award-nominated filmmaker & Cornell alum Tia Lessin '86 will present two of her politicial documentaries.

Her pioneering sculptures, using latex, fiberglass, and plastics, helped establish the post-minimalist movement. Dying of a brain tumor at age 34, she had a mere decade-long career that, despite its brevity, is dense with complex, intriguing works that defy easy categorization. Eva Hesse, the first feature-length appreciation of her life and work, makes superb use of the artist\u2019s voluminous journals, her correspondence with close friend and mentor Sol LeWitt, and contemporary as well as archival interviews with fellow artists (among them, Richard Serra, Robert Mangold, Dan Graham) who recall her passionate, ambitious, tenacious personality. Art critic Arthur Danto has written that her work is: \u2018full of life, of eros, even of comedy\u2026 Each piece vibrates with originality and mischief.\u2019 The documentary captures these qualities, but also the psychic struggles of an artist who, in the downtown New York art scene of the 1960s, was one of the few women to make work that was taken seriously in a field dominated by male pop artists and minimalists.\u201d (Karen Cooper, Film Forum)\n\nThe film utilizes entries from Hesse\u2019s journals and her personal story is a compelling one: she was born in Germany in 1936, left the country with her sister a few years later as part of the Kindertransport rescue effort of Jewish children, was later reunited with her parents in the U.S., and eventually returned to Germany with her artist husband for a residency during which her work blossomed.

As observed from Earth, Venus will appear as a small disc slowing passing across the Sun--an event known as a transit of Venus (TOV).  There is a rich history associated with these transits; June 5th's transit will only be the 7th TOV to be observed since the early 17th century invention of the telescope.  Thereafter, the next TOV will not occur until 2117! \n\nPart of this rare display will be visible from the Fuertes Observatory on Cornell's north campus, and we invite the public to come observe with us. Solar viewing glasses and filtered telescopic views will be provided for your safe viewing pleasure.\n\nNote: Never observe the sun without proper solar filters! Observing the sun without properly designated solar filters can result in potentially significant and permanent eye damage.  You cannot safely observe the transit of Venus with the naked eye or sunglasses.  \n\nLucky for you, CAS has all the filters you'll need. \n\nSo join CAS on the grounds outside the Fuertes observatory for this celestial alignment.  The transit begins slightly after 6pm and continues until sunset (~8:30pm).  Limited parking is available in the Appel parking lot across the street.  We'll keep an eye on the forecast and update you on weather leading up to the event. \n\nRain date: December 11, 2117", "start_time": "2012-06-05T18:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "The Cornell Astronomical Society is a Cornell University student organization that opens the Fuertes Observatory to the public every Friday night.", "name": "The Cornell Astronomical Society & Fuertes Observatory", "emails": ["astrosociety@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c136.2.716.716/s200x200/11031069_786452838101847_8079565582685407519_n.jpg?oh=a976436298a36edf62de81d19035033f&oe=596188AF", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.474413871765, "state": "NY", "street": "Fuertes Observatory", "latitude": 42.452657950712}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/16807345_1261718520575274_9108085076010780535_n.jpg?oh=e3a9664d53c59d04fd6347df29122875&oe=594E27A1", "id": "167659526647851"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c37.0.126.126/255265_10149999016680033_2113097174_n.jpg?oh=cc7b46fdccd377c6ea2fc0d211555793&oe=59607094", "end_time": null, "cover_picture": null, "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "355774464479917", "name": "The Transit of Venus"}, {"category": "DINING_EVENT", "distance": 1519.9840758008208, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "We are hiring all positions and setting up a table outside of the restaurant:\n\nToday 11:00-4:00\nThurs 3:00-7:00\nFri 11:00-4:00 \n\nCome fill out an application!", "start_time": "2016-07-07T11:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Simeon's has re-opened their doors for the public to enjoy an experience featuring new American Bistro cuisine, great drinks, and welcoming ambience.", "name": "Simeon's Ithaca", "emails": null, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c6.0.200.200/p200x200/14495284_182366615504813_5662777494501277132_n.png?oh=e88d00fb4d27e9319e1a05711ded877b&oe=5952C984", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4958599, "state": "NY", "street": "224 E.

He is a professor of political science at Wells College where he is the chair of the Department of International Studies. He is a visiting scholar at CRP, and a Diasporan fellow at the Center for International Affairs and Diplomacy and an external examiner in the Department of Political Science at the University of Ghana. He has taught political science in institutions such as Suffolk University, Vassar College, Bard College, the University of Massachusetts, Wellesley College, and the University of Liberia where he served as the chair of the Department of Political Science. He was a visiting research fellow at the Center for the Study of International Cooperation in Education at Hiroshima University in Japan, and the coordinator of an advanced research project titled \"Conflicts, Violence, and Peace in the Great Lakes Region of Africa.\" His research and teaching areas include governance and democracy, comparative politics, international political economy, international relations, environmental policy, education, and development. His works deal with various world regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, South America) and North-South relations.\n\nLumumba-Kasongo has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, monographs, and several books. He is the editor-in-chief of African and Asian Studies, published by Brill in The Netherlands; and coeditor of the African Journal of International Affairs published by CODESRIA. He has received several academic and scholarship awards.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis presentation is a \"Land Reforms\" project that was coordinated by Lumumba-Kasongo and through which his edited book, Land Reforms and Natural Resource Conflicts in Africa: New Development Paradigms in the Era of Global Liberalization, was produced.\n\nLumumba-Kasongo will discuss theoretical, methodological, and policy issues related to this project. The overall analysis is on a critical examination of the place and role of land in political or state formation and the African political economy. Land as an economic resource within both national economic development and liberal globalization is examined comparatively and historically as part of colonial and post-colonial policy imperatives that have been rooted in four related claims: the struggle over scarce resources, especially access to land resources; actual or perceived abundance of natural resources mismanaged or appropriated by the states, local power systems, and multinationals; weakness or absence of articulated land tenure policies, leading to speculation or hybrid policy framework; and the imperatives of the global liberalization based on the free market principles to regulate the land question and mineral appropriation issue. It is argued that the actualization of these combined claims have led to conflicts among ethnic groups or between them and governments. This project is not only about conflicts, but also about local policy achievements that have been produced on the land question. It provides a critical understanding of the forces and claims related to land tenure systems, as part of the state policy and its system of governance.", "start_time": "2017-03-31T12:12:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p240x240/17436273_1319686384780811_6627521986865624448_o.jpg?oh=05ff8fe1bb50df6be06eca26e8bcbccc&oe=5968FAF2", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c70.0.200.200/p200x200/17362545_1314322005317249_2157038170787481410_n.jpg?oh=aacff4158adece527532e0354a3de1ce&oe=594FF4DC", "end_time": "2017-03-31T13:30:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/17388820_1314322005317249_2157038170787481410_o.jpg?oh=a0aea9992cd2a191ed3dbae9ff7048c2&oe=5996FF7A", "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "431813353832931", "name": "Tukumbi Lumumba-Kasongo: Land Reform & Conflicts in Africa"}, {"category": "ART_FILM", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "Echo Eggebrecht's work has been exhibited in group and solo shows at spaces such as the Dallas Museum of Art; Ulrich Museum, Wichita; Brooklyn Academy of Art; Lincoln Museum, Edinburgh; Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, Manhattan; Ter Caemer Mert, Belgium; Groeflin Maag, Zurich; and Horton Gallery, Manhattan.

Neuerer investigates the cultural and historical context of exhibition making and limits of exhibition space through images and installations in various media. His book projects and collaborations involve both writing and public engagement. His recent project Glass and Not Glass took over public vitrines throughout the city of Innsbruck, Austria. The project negotiated the display of resin and glass casts of ice crystals \u2014 which were found inside an abandoned 1943\u201345 Nazi regime molybdenum mine in the Alps \u2014 within public and private sites. The project revealed a fragile network of narratives blending history, imagination, physical phenomena, and relationships to landscape and place. Neuerer's work repeatedly asks for the role of the record \u2014 especially of the photographic image \u2014 that he approaches less as a means of representation and more as an instrument of engagement in the process of understanding and feeling of the past and present.

Recent advances in computation, visualization, material intelligence, and fabrication technologies have begun to alter fundamentally our theoretical understanding of general design principles as well as our practical approach towards architecture and research. This renewed interest in broadening the discipline has offered alternative methods for investigating the interrelationships of parts to their wholes, and emergent self-organized material systems at multiple scales and applications.\n\nThis symposium features pioneers who are leading this new field through rigorous multi-directional and multi-disciplinary investigations that are shaping the future trajectories of these material innovations and technologies for architecture. The symposium aims to advance materials research and digital fabrication across disciplines in order to effect pragmatic change in the economical, ecological, and cultural production of complex built forms. Participants from diverse disciplinary backgrounds investigate the intersections of architecture and science, and apply insights and theories from biology, engineering, and mathematics to the design, fabrication, and production of material structures. The main thrust of this symposium concerns the evolution, discourse, and application of material and digital fabrication processes in architecture.\n\nThe symposium is being held in conjunction with the launch of the new program, Matter Design Computation, housed within the graduate field of architecture at Cornell University.

Simple objects become cultural interfaces. Through them, Sonya Clark navigates accord and discord. When trying to unravel complex issues, she is instinctively drawn to ordinary things that connect to her personal narrative \u2014 a comb, a cloth, or a strand of hair. Charged with agency, these objects have the mysterious ability to reflect or absorb us. As a point of departure, Clark finds her image, her personal story, in an object. But it is also the object's ability to act as a rhizome, the multiple ways in which it can be discovered or read by a wide audience, that draws her in. To sustain her practice, she milks the object, its potential, its image, and its materiality and history. Clark manipulates objects and materials in a formal manner to engage the viewer in a conversation about collective meaning. She trusts that her stories, your stories, our stories collectively are held in the object. A visual vocabulary forms a facet of language ranging from the vernacular to the political to the poetic. In this way, the everyday \"thing\" becomes a lens through which we may better see one another.\n\nLECTURE: March 9, 5:15 p.m.\nLocation: Abby and Howard Milstein Auditorium, Milstein Hall, Cornell University\nMORE: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/sonya-clark-thread-hair-lineage-language\n\nIn partnership with American studies and Africana studies.", "start_time": "2017-03-09T17:15:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p240x240/17436273_1319686384780811_6627521986865624448_o.jpg?oh=05ff8fe1bb50df6be06eca26e8bcbccc&oe=5968FAF2", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/16998849_1290975544318562_3764724290766167491_n.jpg?oh=89a74944551a496428398c20e8b8e1c3&oe=596B3AC9", "end_time": "2017-03-09T18:15:00-0500", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16998849_1290975544318562_3764724290766167491_n.jpg?oh=176197f34e304d51856fceadf98924c1&oe=595DE142", "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "1891326377767938", "name": "Sonya Clark: A Thread, a Hair, a Lineage, a Language"}, {"category": "OTHER", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 2}, "description": "Sheila Crane is associate professor of architectural history and director of the Ph.D. program in art and architectural history at the University of Virginia.

He worked in the office of Louis I. Kahn in 1957 and 1959. From 1962 to 1986, he practiced as an architect in Africa, the Middle and Far East, the U.S., and Europe, specializing in the design of schools, hospitals, universities, and new cities. In 1986, he founded the Cornell in Rome program, which he directed until 1992. In Italy, his architectural office, Studio Einaudi, specializes in museums (Capitoline Museum, Museo dei Gessi at La Sapienza in Rome, and archaeological museums in Grosseto, Sassoferrato, and Anagni); in the restoration of historical buildings (the American Academy in Rome, Villa Aurelia, St. Paul's within the walls) and urban sites (Venice historical center, Roman Imperial Fora project, an ancient Roman theater in Naples); and currently the design and supervision of a project involving modern athletic facilities, underground parking, and restoration of ancient palazzi in an archaeologically significant area of central Naples.\n\nEinaudi contributed to La lezione di Pier Luigi Nervi, published by Bruno Mondadori in 2010, and is currently working on the critical reedition of Aesthetics and Technology in Building by Nervi, to be published by University of Illinois Press in 2017. He is also updating and translating into English the fundamental text Roma Moderna by Italo Insolera to be published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing in 2017. He is actively writing and drawing about dreams, nature, family history, and the poets Keats and Shelley.\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs a young architecture student at Cornell in the late 1950s, Einaudi was struck by the beauty of Pier Luigi Nervi's work and by the multiplicity of his interests, ranging from the design of boats to the construction of long span buildings in reinforced concrete, to the creation of exquisite and delicate prefabricated forms. Einaudi convinced Cornell to give him a leave of absence for a year to follow Nervi's lectures at the University of Rome. Upon his return, Einaudi's professors had him organize his notes to make them available. The year Einaudi went to MIT (1961\u201362) for his M.Arch., Nervi was awarded the Norton Poetry Chair at nearby Harvard. He asked Einaudi to be the interpreter for his lectures and subsequently to help prepare and translate the resulting book, Aesthetics and Technology in Building. This lecture covers Nervi's work and the reasons behind it.\n\nMore info: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/roberto-einaudi-learning-pier-luigi-nervi", "start_time": "2017-02-16T18:00:00+0100", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p240x240/17436273_1319686384780811_6627521986865624448_o.jpg?oh=05ff8fe1bb50df6be06eca26e8bcbccc&oe=5968FAF2", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.0.200.200/p200x200/16684160_1272862979463152_2910876929295686028_n.jpg?oh=24a822b1ae0e69a141872dff326c8752&oe=5999AA43", "end_time": "2017-02-16T19:00:00+0100", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16684160_1272862979463152_2910876929295686028_n.jpg?oh=d961ffc1ed23c67eef9c53da69444f8b&oe=596AC2B1", "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "748627408637944", "name": "Lecture: Roberto Einaudi: Learning from Pier Luigi Nervi"}, {"category": "OTHER", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 1, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 5}, "description": "Talk with the architects!\n\nNguyen Hai Long and Tran Thi Ngu Ngon will deliver a public lecture on February 15 at 5:15 p.m. Please join the architects the next morning for a follow-up discussion and open question and answer period to discuss the issues that motivate them. \n\nLocation: Stepped Auditorium, Milstein Hall, Cornell University\n\nMore info: \nhttps://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/nguyen-hai-long-and-tran-thi-ngu-ngon-open-discussion", "start_time": "2017-02-16T11:00:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p240x240/17436273_1319686384780811_6627521986865624448_o.jpg?oh=05ff8fe1bb50df6be06eca26e8bcbccc&oe=5968FAF2", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/16640826_1272843759465074_6343270876830816988_n.jpg?oh=7968220f73a2df10c8a77b005c20cc84&oe=5960E485", "end_time": "2017-02-16T12:00:00-0500", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16640826_1272843759465074_6343270876830816988_n.jpg?oh=3716b89108abfe500331a361caeab794&oe=5998140E", "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "1819330678330532", "name": "Open Discussion with Nguyen Hai Long and Tran Thi Ngu Ngon"}, {"category": "LECTURE", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 3, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 5}, "description": "FXFOWLE Lecture for Sustainability, Urbanism, and Design\n\nTake a look at the insects. We wonder why when the world outside is constantly changing, they are still able to exist in their nests, without any modern equipment. They remain as a part of the earth. Vietnamese people are used to calling home a \"warm nest,\" where we return from work, school, or trips. It is a place to rest and take care of each other. While the insect's nest has not changed, people's \"warm nests\" are changing significantly. Vietnam is a developing country, which means that it is facing many critical issues including environmental pollution, serious traffic congestion, contaminated food, social security, the gap between rich and poor \u2014 and the most serious concern for the architects, which is people's overdependence on electrical equipment and smart devices.\n\nThese issues motivated Nguyen Hai Long and Tran Thi Ngu Ngon to study how to address the situation. They chose the largest economic segment of Vietnam's population for this research \u2014 the middle-income working class. Instead of the dark and cramped living spaces, the architects create houses (nests) full of light and natural ventilation, which leads to limited use of devices, energy savings, simple materials, functional simplicity, sharing of space, and construction cost savings.\n\nMore information: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/nests-tropics", "start_time": "2017-02-15T17:15:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p240x240/17436273_1319686384780811_6627521986865624448_o.jpg?oh=05ff8fe1bb50df6be06eca26e8bcbccc&oe=5968FAF2", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/16508182_1271862252896558_4710908074936389349_n.jpg?oh=7efb7f404cc7a200ea2a3ad26e3f59ba&oe=595EBD85", "end_time": "2017-02-15T18:15:00-0500", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16508182_1271862252896558_4710908074936389349_n.jpg?oh=15b78c17dbfc914ea04e60bc99f5469d&oe=594D0B0E", "time_from_now": -1490749196.0, "type": "public", "id": "1436351489732250", "name": "Nguyen Hai Long and Tran Thi Ngu Ngon: Nests in the Tropics"}, {"category": "LECTURE", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 8, "declined": 0, "maybe": 1}, "description": "Jessica Vaughn, who was born in 1983 in Chicago, is a visual artist living and working in Brooklyn.

The Yellow Ticket (1918) is a German drama made at the end of World War I and on the eve of the Russian revolution. It stars an adolescent Pola Negri, who would later become the legendary femme fatale of the silent era, and tells the story of an innocent young Jewish woman from a Polish shtetl who is constrained by anti-Semitic restrictions to lead a double life in a brothel while attempting to study medicine in Tsarist Russia. The film includes precious footage of the former Jewish quarter of Warsaw and the people who once lived there. Alicia Svigals is a leading klezmer violinist and a founder of the Klezmatics, has written for violinist Itzhak Perlman, the Kronos Quartet, playwright Tony Kushner and singer Diane Birch, and has also collaborated with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, poet Allen Ginsburg and many others.

Risley is mostly self-governed, with \u201cKommittee\u201d as its main governing body.  While the RHD and other staff members of the building provide structure, guidance and support, community members are highly involved in how the community functions from year to year.  Risley also has several shops that are open for student use including painting, printmaking, digital video editing, woodworking, ceramics, sewing, audio recording, jewelry making, stained glass, a general art shop, as well as an 81 seat black-box theater, a black and white darkroom, a dining hall, performance space, a library, lounge space and a dance studio.

This special town-gown event is geared toward CU & IC faculty members, graduate/professional students and Ithaca community members, who are invited to socialize at a reception in between the offering of two films directed by multimedia artist Laurie Anderson. Heart of a Dog (75 mins, 2015) is a lyrical, collage-like film that centers on Anderson\u2019s beloved rat terrier Lolabelle, who died in 2011. It\u2019s a personal essay that weaves together childhood memories, video diaries, philosophical musings on data collection, surveillance culture and the Buddhist conception of the afterlife, and heartfelt tributes to the artists, writers, musicians and thinkers who inspire her. \n\nIt will be followed by a reception at 8:15pm, when we\u2019ll turn our lobby into a lounge where patrons can mingle and discuss the film while sipping a glass of complimentary beer or wine (courtesy of Sparrow\u2019s Fine Wines) and nibbling on light hors d\u2019oeuvres. (Non-alcoholic beverages will also be available.)\n\nAt 9:15pm, we\u2019ll show Home of the Brave (90 mins, 1986), Anderson\u2019s highly enjoyable performance film, \u201can eye-popping tapestry stitched with video, chaotic choreography, subtitles, and wild props such as dancing shirts and a so-called drum suit that turns the singer\u2019s entire body into a percussive instrument.\u201d (Variety) It will be shown in a rare 35mm archival print.\n\nAdvance tickets for this special event are $20 and are available now at CornellCinemaTickets.com. Door sales will be $25. Comps and passes not accepted.

Among the best of a great 2015 crop of teen films.\n\nPediatric Cancer Awareness Club \n\nPCAC works to raise awareness and funds for pediatric cancer, while also participating in community service for children with cancer. We have ongoing projects in conjunction with Sunrise Day Camp, a camp for kids with cancer and their siblings located in Long Island, NY, as well as other organizations helping children with cancer. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Pediatric-Cancer-Awareness-Club-of-Cornell/455885731216239\n\n\nColleges Against Cancer \n\nColleges Against Cancer is a club that holds various cancer fundraisers and awareness events throughout the year (including breast cancer awareness week and the great American smoke-out). Our biggest event is our annual Relay for Life, an all-night cancer fundraiser where we celebrate cancer survivors, remember those we've lost, and fight back against this terrible disease. Relay is an event that includes members of our club along with the larger Cornell community. We fundraise before and during the event, which features speakers, performances, food, and activities. This past semester, we raised over $85,000 for the American Cancer Society.\n\nhttp://main.acsevents.org/site/TR?pg=entry&fr_id=72916\n\n\nCupcakes for a Cure\n\nCupcakes for a Cure was started in 2011 at the University of Central Florida by a group of LEAD Scholars students. To date, we have donated over $20,000 to pediatric cancer patients in local communities. \n\nCupcakes for a Cure at UCF donates all funds raised to BASE Camp Children's Cancer Foundation (basecamp.org) to help change the lives of children battling cancer through our cupcake sales. Not only do we donate to pediatric cancer patients, but we also form close relationships with the children by volunteering at BASE Camp events such as weekly lunch deliveries to Arnold Palmer Hospital, monthly overnight camps at hotels, and other special events such as BASE Camp's prom.\n\nCupcakes for a Cure started at Cornell University this past Fall. At Cornell, our sales are geared towards raising money for Sunrise Day Camp, the only dedicated full summer day camp for children with cancer. Sunrise Day Camp allows children with cancer and their siblings to attend entirely for free, alleviating the financial burden on families who have already spent extensive amounts of money on treatments. The original camp is located in Long Island, NY in 2006. Since then, Sunrise Day Camp has also been initiated in Pearl River, NY as well as in Israel.

The film captures Schneemann in her own words, images and reflections, at work, at home, in the studio, and interweaves extensive film excerpts from her groundbreaking film work in both super 8 and 16mm such as Fuses (1967); Kitch\u2019s Last Meal (1973-76), with documentation of performances including Meat Joy (1964); Interior Scroll (1975) and more recent museum commissions and exhibitions. By highlighting the sheen of photographic prints, the fibres of diary pages and the gloss of wet paint, Breaking The Frame provides a textured mise-en-scene that resonates with Schneemann\u2019s corporeal focus. The visual composition is complemented by a soundtrack featuring the music of composer James Tenney. Tenney was Schneemann\u2019s companion and collaborator for many years, and the two remained close friends until his death in 2006.\n\nMore at breakingtheframe.com \n\n2012 > Canada > Directed by Marielle Nitoslawska\n1 hr 40 min", "start_time": "2014-11-19T19:15:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Cinema has been cited as one of the best campus film exhibition programs in the country, screening close to 150 different films/videos each year, five nights a week in the beautiful Willard Straight Theatre.", "name": "Cornell Cinema", "emails": null, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c24.0.200.200/p200x200/1175506_10153160570160529_509717013_n.jpg?oh=44ab5d49a650be63ad079b10cf2c0951&oe=595B4C39", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4860489, "state": "NY", "street": "104 Willard Straight Hall", "latitude": 42.4458606}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17634849_10158620433520529_3336516412665958022_n.png?oh=c6f3e070e585cde2d484fde9f28a9c1d&oe=59502445", "id": "215249100528"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c78.0.200.200/p200x200/10492086_10154828706800529_4317854849873230840_n.jpg?oh=a31d3c6ea4454aa3bf862603bf82cfb4&oe=5992B438", "end_time": null, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/10382275_10154828706800529_4317854849873230840_o.jpg?oh=c25e7e449fe5382be48dcedbd85257e7&oe=5957CC87", "time_from_now": -1491074533.0, "type": "public", "id": "573027869510095", "name": "BREAKING THE FRAME with filmmaker Marielle Nitoslawska and artist Carolee Schneemann"}, {"category": "FITNESS", "distance": 576.0400472881252, "stats": {"attending": 26, "noreply": 606, "declined": 0, "maybe": 9}, "description": "Come join CFC for the official grand opening of Appel Fitness Center!

This brilliantly crafted Shakespeare adaptation was the culmination of Welles\u2019s lifelong obsession with the Bard\u2019s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff, the loyal, often soused childhood friend of King Henry IV\u2019s wayward son, Prince Hal. Appearing in several plays as a comic supporting figure, Falstaff is here the main event: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero, played by Welles with lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both Henry IV plays as well as Richard II, Henry V, and The Merry Wives of Windsor, Welles created an unorthodox Shakespeare film that is also a gritty period piece, one that he called \u201ca lament . . . for the death of Merrie England.\u201d\n\nPoetic, philosophical, and visceral\u2014with a kinetic battle sequence centerpiece as impressive as anything else Welles directed\u2014Chimes at Midnight is as monumental as the figure at its center. \u201cIf I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that\u2019s the one I would offer up.\u201d\u2014Orson Welles\n\nLarry Jackson \u201970, producer and former industry exec, worked with Welles on his unfinished film The Other Side of the Wind as well as Filming Othello.

She is adopted Korean-Polish-Italian-American, and grew up in the suburbs of Rochester where she obsessively made mix tapes from 90\u2019s radio airplay and built makeshift forts in the woods. (These factors alone have influenced her art practice immensely.) She received her BFA from The Cleveland Institute of Art majoring in Fiber and Material Studies in 2007, and graduated with an MFA from Concordia University\u2019s Fiber and Material Practices in 2013.\n \nSarah helped found The Color Collective, an initiative to grow sustainable dyes in Montr\u00e9al without the interference of machines or chemical fertilizers. This collaboration led to the instruction of many workshops at the Concordia University Greenhouse and Montr\u00e9al Center for Contemporary Textiles, as well as exhibitions at the Textile Museum of Canada, the International Symposium & Exhibition on Natural Dyes in LaRochelle, France, and at the 13th Biennial Symposium of The Textile Society of America in Washington DC.\n \nAfter receiving her MFA she moved back to upstate New York and began growing natural dye plants in her Trumansburg backyard. She has collaborated with Cornell, Ithaca College, the Community Arts Partnership of Ithaca, The Craftstitute, New Roots Charter School, and The Truamansburg Conservatory of Fine Arts giving various workshops on natural dye plants and textile practices.", "start_time": "2016-03-13T11:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Admission is always free! | Twitter & Instagram @HFJMuseum", "name": "Herbert F.

The Willard Straight Theatre will be transformed into a gambling parlor of sorts to create the perfect atmosphere for screenings of collage artist/animator Lewis Klahr\u2019s The Pettifogger, about a year in the life of an American gambler and con man circa 1963, and The Sting, starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford as a pair of 1930s confidence men. Newman and Redford are joined by the late actor Harold Gould, who earned two graduate degrees in theater at Cornell (M.A. '48, Ph.D. '53), before going on to a successful career on Broadway and in Hollywood. The evening kicks off with a cocktail reception from 7:30 \u2013 8:45pm, during which time The Pettifogger will be screened while local musician A.J. Strauss provides jazzy piano music. Patrons can enjoy scrumptious hors d\u2019oeuvres and desserts, courtesy of some of Ithaca\u2019s finest dining and catering establishments, as well as a cash bar. There will also be complimentary tastings of Meleau specialty wines, courtesy of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bouch\u00e9 of Ports of New York.

Her first feature film as editor, Experimenter, premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and was a selection of the prestigious New York Film Festival. \u201cMichael Almereyda\u2019s brilliant portrait of Stanley Milgram, the social scientist whose 1961, Yale-based \u201cobedience study\u201d reflected back on the Holocaust and anticipated Abu Ghraib and other atrocities carried out by ordinary people who were just following orders, places its subject in an appropriately experimental cinema framework. The proverbial elephant in the room materializes on screen; Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard) sometimes addresses the camera directly as if to implicate us in his studies and the unpleasant truths they reveal. Remarkably, the film evokes great compassion for this uncompromising, difficult man, in part because we often see him through the eyes of his wife (Winona Ryder, in a wonderfully grounded performance), who fully believed in his work and its profoundly moral purpose.

The host for the festivities\u2014local author, celeb and Trampoline founder, Bob Proehl\u2014will lead the audience through a vocal warm up, judge the costume competition and award prizes, and demonstrate how to use the interactive fun-pack.\n\nWhen all is song and done, including pre-show activities, movie and intermission, this fun-packed event will last about 3 1/2 hours and no doubt provide a lasting memory for all those who attend. The last time Cornell Cinema presented it, we sold-out both shows, so patrons are encouraged to buy their tickets in advance!

The restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's nine surviving silent films has been the biggest and more complex restoration project undertaken by the BFI National Archive to date. Decades of damage and wear have been removed; the sharpness of the image improved; new shots discovered and intertitles and tinting restored. The BFI has used elements borrowed from seven international archives in the restoration process but film materials from the BFI National Archive - including a number of original negatives - have been central to the project. Hitchcock's silent films are essential to an understanding of his later work and these restoration now enable them to be seen afresh and discovered by new audiences across the world. \n\nFour of our selections will be accompanued live on piano by Dr. Philip Carli - one of the best silent film accompanists in the world - one of which, the fantastic CHAMPAGNE, will be presented as the featured event at this year's Elegant Winter Party on Feb 22.

The restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's nine surviving silent films has been the biggest and more complex restoration project undertaken by the BFI National Archive to date. Decades of damage and wear have been removed; the sharpness of the image improved; new shots discovered and intertitles and tinting restored. The BFI has used elements borrowed from seven international archives in the restoration process but film materials from the BFI National Archive - including a number of original negatives - have been central to the project. Hitchcock's silent films are essential to an understanding of his later work and these restoration now enable them to be seen afresh and discovered by new audiences across the world. \n\nFour of our selections will be accompanued live on piano by Dr. Philip Carli - one of the best silent film accompanists in the world - one of which, the fantastic CHAMPAGNE, will be presented as the featured event at this year's Elegant Winter Party on Feb 22.

Building on her activism in Pakistan, Yousafzai has since emerged as a leading global campaigner for the educational rights of girls worldwide.

Tonight's program, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Lewis Carroll\u2019s classic novel, features five recent films including Blue Skies Beyond the Looking Glass, which invites viewers to trip the light fantastic with an array of silent film stars including Buster Keaton and Lillian Gish; Beyond Enchantment, wherein Victorian women encounter science and natural phenomena; and Cosmic Alchemy, where magnificently colored ancient star maps take the viewer into a world of cosmic imagination. Soundtracks accompany all of the films and range from classical to mambo to avant-garde.  Cosponsored with the Cornell Council for the Arts.

We have not received an increase in NINE YEARS (!!) and CANNOT CONTINUE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF PROGRAMMING WITHOUT ONE. The SA will be voting on their Appropriations Committee\u2019s recommendation (see below) to hold our funding at its current level of $10.60/student and we NEED YOUR HELP to overturn this recommendation, and instead, increase our allocation to $12/student.\n\nPLEASE CONTACT your SA representative before Thursday\u2019s meeting to express your support for this increase. A list of voting members can be found at: http://assembly.cornell.edu/SA/Members\n\nCC has ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT CUTS to the operation to accommodate the lack of additional funding from the SA over the past nine years, cope with increases in costs to run the program (inevitable over 9 years), and weather reductions in funding from both external & internal sources due to economic strains at the State & University levels. \n\nWe have also had to deplete our general reserve account to cover the cost of the necessary upgrade to digital cinema, something that benefits all of our viewers and makes it possible for us to do advance screenings of films like STEVE JOBS. \n\nNevertheless, the SA Appropriations Committee has recommended level funding for the next two years. THEY ALSO RECOMMEND THAT WE FURTHER CUT THE PROGRAM TO GET BY. In essence, they are proposing that we REDUCE the DIVERSITY of our offerings. \n\nAnd all of this even though last year there were close to 11,000 undergraduate admissions to our events, an increase of 1,300 from the year before.\n\nPLEASE HELP US MAINTAIN ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES ON THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS!\n\nJOIN US ON THURSDAY! THANKS!!\n\nRationale of the Appropriations Committee:\n\u201cThe Appropriations Committee recommends funding Cornell Cinema at $10.60 for the 2016-2018 By-Line Funding Cycle. Although the Committee believes that Cornell Cinema provides some value to students, they do not believe that an increase was justified given current attendance numbers relative to the amount students spent on tickets and the activity fee. Despite significant cost increases, the Committee does not believe it is the Fee\u2019s responsibility to continually and consistently cover the rising cost of doing business within the cinema industry. Moving forward, the Committee suggests that Cornell Cinema determine ways to reduce costs by either more selectively showing screenings, reducing the number of days that Cornell Cinema is open, or find alternative mechanisms to reduce their costs. The Committee appreciates the importance of the cinematic experience to Cornell students, but they question whether or not the current model is sustainable given historical trends to request increases from the activity fee and raise ticket prices.\u201d\n\nFor perspective, consider this: the SA currently allocates $18/student to the Slope Day Programming Committee to present a one-day event that costs $350,000. The activity fee allocation covers 70% of this budget. \n\nCornell Cinema presents 180 programs/year offered in close to 300 screenings that are presented 5 nights/week during the academic year. CC\u2019s annual operating budget is $485,000, which includes the cost of the infrastructure (staffing, space rental, equipment, etc) needed to run a weekly film program. Our current allocation from the activity fee covers 30% of our budget. If we were to receive the increase we\u2019ve requested ($12/student), the coverage would go up to 33%.", "start_time": "2015-10-15T16:45:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Cinema has been cited as one of the best campus film exhibition programs in the country, screening close to 150 different films/videos each year, five nights a week in the beautiful Willard Straight Theatre.", "name": "Cornell Cinema", "emails": null, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c24.0.200.200/p200x200/1175506_10153160570160529_509717013_n.jpg?oh=44ab5d49a650be63ad079b10cf2c0951&oe=595B4C39", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4860489, "state": "NY", "street": "104 Willard Straight Hall", "latitude": 42.4458606}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17634849_10158620433520529_3336516412665958022_n.png?oh=c6f3e070e585cde2d484fde9f28a9c1d&oe=59502445", "id": "215249100528"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c35.0.200.200/p200x200/12122696_10156152558225529_1732394585478076242_n.jpg?oh=6de4f8d3f54d47110256503db373b5af&oe=5957EAFF", "end_time": null, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12122696_10156152558225529_1732394585478076242_n.jpg?oh=cff47916dfce87206d8d4d3adfabbf71&oe=595176E8", "time_from_now": -1491074772.0, "type": "public", "id": "498175893690349", "name": "Save Cornell Cinema!"}, {"category": "ART_EVENT", "distance": 473.41659434106225, "stats": {"attending": 17, "noreply": 156, "declined": 0, "maybe": 27}, "description": "Risley is holding an exposition of student art created in the Residence Hall's workshops.

Kennedy said \u201cNothing compares to the simple pleasure of riding a bicycle.\u201d  How true for many people.  And to a surprising number of visual artists, bicycles bring not only pleasure but also creative inspiration. \n \nFor the month of May, you can see the output of that inspiration at Two Wheels to Freedom: Ithaca\u2019s First Annual Juried Bike Art Show, showing at Collegetown Bagels downtown on Aurora Street.  The works of eighteen Ithaca-based or Ithaca-connected artists are brought together in a vibrant collection of bicycle themed photographs, prints, and paintings.  You\u2019ll see images of bicycles from around Ithaca and around the world; images of cyclists who go fast, and cyclists who take their time; three tributes to cyclists lost to tragic events; an abstract impression of learning to ride; and numerous celebrations of the feeling of freedom one often gets when out on a bicycle ride.  Included in the show are artists Susan Keough, Robert Grant, Taliah Lempert, Jon Reis, Laura Glenn, Sara Gaechter, Margaret Corbit, Jeanne Leccese, Karen James, Leslie Sandman, Gwen Elizabeth Bullock, Susan Larkin, Rebecca Godin, Jane grace Taylor, Katherine Banko, Molly Bargar, Annamiek Haralson, and Susan Verberg. The opening reception is 5-8pm on Friday May 2nd, as part of Downtown Ithaca\u2019s gallery night.  The show runs from May 1st to May 31st and is open daily from 6:30am to 8pm.\n \nTwo Wheels to Freedom has a selection committee of five local artists and art organizers, and is coordinated by the Creating Healthy Places Project, which has a mission to help people get more daily activity in their lives.   Just as every participating artist brings their own personal intention to their work, the coordinators bring an intention to the overall show; they hope the art will inspire viewers to enjoy the beauty that can be found in bicycles and be inspired to add more bicycling to their daily lives.\n \nThis first annual bicycle art show is also one of a number of local events celebrating National Bike Month, including Streets Alive! Ithaca on Sunday May 4th and Bike to Work and School Day on Friday May 16. \nThese events are part of the community wide effort to improve conditions and awareness of bicycling as a viable means of transportation:  a green, clean, healthy and beautiful way to get around. \n \n \nINFO: Victoria Armstrong, Creating Healthy Places Project, Human Services Coalition of Tompkins County, \n607-273-8686 or see http://streetsaliveithaca.com/bike-art-show\nAlso http://collegetownbagels.com/events.php\nAlso http://gallerynightithaca.wordpress.com/\n \nOther Bike Month events:\nwww.streetsaliveithaca.com\nhttp://ccetompkins.org/calendar", "start_time": "2014-05-02T17:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "High-quality, unique and delicious food and beverages.

Realizing that she is at a crossroads in her life, bored twenty-something Taeko heads for the countryside. The trip dredges up forgotten childhood memories which unfold in flashback to younger years: the first immature stirrings of romance, the onset of puberty, and the frustrations of math and boys. In lyrical switches between the present and the past, Taeko wonders if she has been true to the dreams of her childhood self. Directed by Isao Takahata (The Tale of the Princess Kaguya) and produced by Hayao Miyazaki, Only Yesterday is a double period piece that beautifully evokes both the 1960s and 1980s, and the quintessential drama of Japanese school-day nostalgia. \u201cLike [Takahata\u2019s] Princess Kaguya, it functions as a highly sensitive and empathetic consideration of the situation of women in Japanese society\u2014but it\u2019s also a breathtaking work of art on its own.\u201d (RogerEbert.com) Shown in original Japanese language with subtitles. 1 hr 58 mins.

The Shabbaton itself is completely free\u2014you only need pay for your transportation to Cornell. \n\nInterested in attending or have any questions whatsoever?\nPlease email Rachel Blady '13 at vpcomm@cornellcjl.com\nIf you are reserving a spot for the Shabbaton, please include your name, address, phone number, high school and year. After making reservations, you will be contacted to confirm your attendance and to provide more details about the Shabbaton. \n\n\nWhy should I visit?\nAs a Jewish student, Shabbat will play a large an important role in your college experience. No matter what your level of observance, Shabbat is a time to relax, hang out with friends, and just have fun. Because of this, Shabbat is a great time to get a sense of the Jewish community and of the overall university culture\u2014you\u2019ll learn far more about Cornell on this shabbaton then you will by doing online research, etc. In addition, this is a chance to meet potential future classmates and upperclassmen, so you\u2019ll know people and already have friends if you come in August. (Or next August, as it\u2019s not uncommon for students to spend a year in Israel)\t\n\nWhere will I stay?\nStudents will have the option of staying in the Center for Jewish Living, which is a privately owned house where many Jewish students live, or to be hosted by first-year students in the freshman dorms. \n \nWhat will I do? \nAttend services of your choice, join over a hundred students at Shabbat dinner, ask current students any questions on your mind, eat some good food and have a great time! Planned optional activities include a nature walk through Cornell\u2019s amazing waterfalls, Q&A panel with students from different majors, and bowling and a midnight BBQ after Shabbat. \n\nHow do I get there?\nFor those living in the New York area, driving is the best option. Ithaca is about four hours from New York City. There are also regular buses from New York City, North Jersey, and Long Island\u2014check out shortlinebus.com. For those living a bit farther away, the Ithaca airport is about ten minutes from campus. If you fly in, we\u2019ll be glad to pick you up from the airport. \n\n\nPlease forward this event to seniors and juniors who are considering universities with vibrant Jewish life.

With this film, Tod Browning\u2014who would go on to direct the cult classic Freaks (1932)\u2014and his crew set the bar by which all vampire films before or since have come to be measured. The story of Renfield\u2019s naive downward spiral and Dracula\u2019s consequent descent onto London is a familiar one, yet rarely has it been so vividly brought to life (or death, as it were) as in this Universal Pictures gem. With the sole possible exception of F. W. Murnau\u2019s silent Nosferatu (1922), Browning\u2019s masterpiece is without equal in the annals of blood-thirsty cinema. The shadowy cinematography, courtesy of Karl Freund, makes it a quintessential experience that no film lover should miss. Often imitated yet inimitable, parodied yet irresistible, this is where it all began. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible not to love Dracula, a horror milestone that is the most important and influential vampire movie ever made.\u201d (IMDB) \n\n\nSHOWINGS:\nMonday, October 3, 7:00, WSH\nTuesday, October 4, 9:15, WSH", "start_time": "2011-10-03T19:00:00-0700", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Cinema has been cited as one of the best campus film exhibition programs in the country, screening close to 150 different films/videos each year, five nights a week in the beautiful Willard Straight Theatre.", "name": "Cornell Cinema", "emails": null, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c24.0.200.200/p200x200/1175506_10153160570160529_509717013_n.jpg?oh=44ab5d49a650be63ad079b10cf2c0951&oe=595B4C39", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4860489, "state": "NY", "street": "104 Willard Straight Hall", "latitude": 42.4458606}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17634849_10158620433520529_3336516412665958022_n.png?oh=c6f3e070e585cde2d484fde9f28a9c1d&oe=59502445", "id": "215249100528"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c37.0.126.126/255265_10149999016680033_2113097174_n.jpg?oh=cc7b46fdccd377c6ea2fc0d211555793&oe=59607094", "end_time": "2011-10-04T21:00:00-0700", "cover_picture": null, "time_from_now": -1491073695.0, "type": "public", "id": "1049989378362923", "name": "DRACULA at Cornell Cinema"}, {"category": null, "distance": 1808.0865630864948, "stats": {"attending": 1, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "EXPLORE \"NANO\": THE NEW MINI-EXHIBITION\nOpens Tuesday, March 6, 10 am-5 pm\nDiscover a world you can't see and learn about real applications of nanotechnology.

Woven throughout the film is the story of Col. William Rankin, who in 1959 was forced to eject from his F8U fighter jet at 48,000 feet without a pressure suit, only to get trapped for 45 minutes in the up and down drafts of a massive thunderstorm, and survive. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, 2009, and its European premiere at the Rotterdam International Film Festival, 2009. Shown with Ray\u2019s Birds (2010, 7 minutes), an homage to Ray Lowden, who keeps seventy-two large birds of prey, five deer and some wallabies at his place in Northumberland, England. Deborah Stratman is a Chicago-based artist and filmmaker interested in landscapes and systems. Her films, rather than telling stories, pose a series of problems - and through their at times ambiguous nature, allow for a complicated reading of the questions being asked. Most recently, they have questioned elemental historical narratives about freedom, expansion, security, and the regulation of space.

Working with new, archival, and distressed footage, Morrison developed the film in collaboration with two-time Grammy-nominated jazz musician Dave Douglas while the two were in residence at Stanford University. Douglas's original score will be performed by his electric band Keystone (a sextet with trumpet, tenor/soprano sax, rhodes, electric bass, drums, and turntables), which was created to work with films. The result is a stunning multimedia piece evoking the complexity and detail of the story's intertwining narratives, which unfolds with a score that is at times bucolic and others explosive. Cosponsored with the Cornell Council for the Arts and the Atkinson Forum in American Studies.

You will find local beers and wines at the newly restored bar.\n\nGreen Drinks\nAs with all Green Drinks events, this event is free and open to the public.  There will be a cash bar.  Stop by anytime between 7 and 10pm.  Please pass this invite out to sustainability-minded friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nThe SEEN\nYou will also have a chance to see and give feedback on the newly developed website for the SEEN.  In the back, this beta site will be displayed on a few laptops.  Bob Rossi and other SEEN leaders will be there to answer questions and take suggestions.  \n\n \nNational Day of Service\nIn 1994, congress passed the King Holiday & Service Act designating MLK Day as a national holiday for MLK volunteer service.   This holiday saw a boost in volunteerism two years ago when President Obama took office.  We commend anyone who has observed this day of service today, but we also want to remind everyone that there's still time!  In fact, there's always time.  Service is not an annual event. Perhaps the best service you can do today is to consider how to serve your community every day. One Kingly approach would be to consider the injustices around you, and then to address them in at least some small way throughout the year.

This is particularly important when connecting with women of color, whose emotions and standards of beauty continue to be policed by mainstream culture. Ask yourself, what is the story behind each woman, and how do \u201cacceptable\u201d emotional responses and standards of beauty preclude us from valuing them. Enjoy!\n\nArtist Statement: Art has always been an integral part of my expression and healing process. As an artist from Brooklyn, New York, I have experienced and seen the heartbreaking struggles of ordinary people. My most powerful works encourage others to embrace the pain in their lives and transform it into something beautiful. \n\nFor more information & to see other works, visit michellekizer.carbonmade.com", "start_time": "2016-01-15T03:00:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "High-quality, unique and delicious food and beverages.

We will show up en masse, eat dinner, get a little Mincha-Maariv, and start building connections with the newest Jews at Cornell!  They're cool people!  We will meet them!  Also, free Hillel food!  \n\nIf you can drive to this, please tell a programmer (pmf46 or maa245)!", "start_time": "2011-08-18T17:00:00-0700", "venue": {"about": "The Center for Jewish Living at Cornell University is an entirely student-run organization comprised of a residence hall and a programming board.", "name": "The Center for Jewish Living at Cornell", "emails": ["vpcomm@cornellcjl.com"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c11.0.200.200/p200x200/10849840_870523126302169_8886379338550598942_n.png?oh=320982d32002f676fd47b25d0d32801e&oe=5968D062", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48792, "state": "NY", "street": "106 West Ave", "latitude": 42.44449}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/10869711_870471936307288_7545258929729620557_o.jpg?oh=9e1ec18068edd8038f1acacf15c570d9&oe=595E6E69", "id": "126298034058019"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c37.0.126.126/255265_10149999016680033_2113097174_n.jpg?oh=cc7b46fdccd377c6ea2fc0d211555793&oe=59607094", "end_time": "2011-08-18T19:00:00-0700", "cover_picture": null, "time_from_now": -1491073660.0, "type": "public", "id": "845178792229056", "name": "CJL Meets Freshmen Fest Freshmen"}, {"category": "MUSIC_EVENT", "distance": 723.5827029052433, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "CTB Jazz Thursdays\nJoin us every Thursday night at the East Hill Collegetown Bagels for live Jazz from 6-7:30pm.

Accompanied by musical guests Harry Aceto & Friends.\n\nArtist's Statement:\n\nI have lived in Ithaca since 1988. I helped raise a family and now have some of said family as well as grandchildren living here. I\u2019ve been drawing and painting for over 40 years but recently have had the opportunity to do so in a more concentrated manner. Some of the results of this work are now on display. \n\nWhat you can expect is simply an appreciation and documentation of the mostly rural world around us, albeit from a working class point of view. All paintings are done within the February to September period of time this year. A majority of the pieces are from the Finger Lakes area; I visited a North Carolina beach in June so there's a few paintings from that trip as well.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in where the sky meets the earth as it reminds me that we are spiritual beings in a material world. I stay close to the ground on a bicycle.

Featured films are The Debt, Friends with Benefits and The Future. \n\nThe Debt, playing at 7:00 PM at Uris Hall. \n2011, color, 1 hour 54 minutes, USA\nIn this remake of the 2007 Israeli film of the same name, director Madden (Shakespeare in Love) jumps between the present and the past, circa 1965, to tell the story of three Mossad agents who were tasked to capture a Nazi war criminal: a doctor who performed brutal experimental surgery on prisoners in the concentration camps. Mirren and Chastain play the elder and younger Rachel, the most compelling of the Mossad agents. And indeed much of the film's drama depends on the considerable acting talents of these two women, and upon the interplay between the younger and older characters. \"The younger actors are more idealistic, more sexually alive, more charged with the shifting dynamics of their missions. The older cast are more dour and tightly wound, carrying the weight of history and high positions atop a foundation of lies, doubt, fear and regret. And whichever trio of actors worked first, you get the sense that all six performances are knit into a single fabric; it's impossible, in effect, to see the three young agents and not see the shadows of the older characters, and vice versa.\" (Portland Oregonian) The result is a complex series of character studies wrapped up within a thriller of surprising moral weight.\n\nFriends with Benefits, playing at 9:30 PM at Uris Hall. \n2011, color, 1 hour 49 minutes, USA\nIn the newest film from Cornell alum and Easy A director Will Gluck '93, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis star as Dylan and Jamie, two friends who, despite the attraction they feel for one another, aren't ready for a new relationship. Instead, they decide it's best to keep things purely physical, a plan which turns out to be much easier said than done. \"Friends with Benefits is fast, allusive, urban, glamorous\u2014clearly the Zeitgeist winner of the summer.\" (The New Yorker)\n\nThe Future, playing at 9:45 PM at Willard Straight Hall. \n2011, color, 1 hour 31 minutes, Germany/USA\nA couple, comprised of two misfits, adopts a stray, maligning cat in order to spice up their lackluster lives. As the cat convalesces, the two of them seize the opportunity to do all the things they thought they didn't have time for before they got the wounded cat. July (of Me, You, and Everyone We Know fame) launches her characters - including the cat - into a dizzyingly cute period of introspection and reflection which changes their perspectives, their ways of life, and the trajectory of time itself. If it sounds funny and far-fetched, that's because it is. As The Onion cryptically put it, \"The Future is elliptical, but never shaggy.\"", "start_time": "2011-12-02T19:00:00-0800", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Cinema has been cited as one of the best campus film exhibition programs in the country, screening close to 150 different films/videos each year, five nights a week in the beautiful Willard Straight Theatre.", "name": "Cornell Cinema", "emails": null, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c24.0.200.200/p200x200/1175506_10153160570160529_509717013_n.jpg?oh=44ab5d49a650be63ad079b10cf2c0951&oe=595B4C39", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4860489, "state": "NY", "street": "104 Willard Straight Hall", "latitude": 42.4458606}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17634849_10158620433520529_3336516412665958022_n.png?oh=c6f3e070e585cde2d484fde9f28a9c1d&oe=59502445", "id": "215249100528"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c37.0.126.126/255265_10149999016680033_2113097174_n.jpg?oh=cc7b46fdccd377c6ea2fc0d211555793&oe=59607094", "end_time": "2011-12-02T22:00:00-0800", "cover_picture": null, "time_from_now": -1491073736.0, "type": "public", "id": "1026094214070008", "name": "Study Break at Cornell Cinema"}, {"category": null, "distance": 1808.0865630864948, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "Have you ever wondered what\u2019s the difference between a frog and toad?

The film reveals the inventiveness derived from the dialogue between each artist's practice and the construction of their handmade homes. The results range from the romantic (Hudson River School painter Frederic Church's Olana, framing views of the Catskills to echo his paintings), to the futuristic (Urbanist Paolo Soleri's silt-casted structure Cosanti growing out of experiments in bell making in the Arizona desert). Commentary from cultural critic Alastair Gordon and an original score by Jamie Rudolph help to evoke the spiritual dimension of the locations and argue the case that the intuitive vision of artists can create great architecture. Featuring the hand-built homes of George Nakashima, Henry Chapman Mercer, Wharton Esherick, Paolo Soleri, Byrdclife Arts Colony, Frederic Church, Henry Varnum Poor, Russel Wright, Raoul Hague and Eliphante.

A team may bat as many different batters as they like.  Free substitutions are allowed throughout the game.  The batting order may not change with the substitutions.  For example, if a player comes late, he must be placed at the end of the batting order, not interrupting the already established lineup.  No pinch runners are allowed.\n5.   Every player must play at least 1 full inning (hitting and fielding)\n6.   Every team must have at least two men and two women\n7.

The truth however is that he came out with a shiny red guitar and full drum set which he proceeded to beat on mercilessly. His life was pretty average really. He spent his early years painting birds but soon realized they couldn\u2019t fly very well with paint in their feathers, so he tried fish but couldn\u2019t seem to make the paint stick. When he was about 11 years old he picked up that shiny red guitar and drumset for the first time since his birth and invented 4 different new styles of post progressive, alt country,neo-folk-hop, Dada music. After a few bad reviews he retreated into the wilderness where he developed an abnormal affinity for rocks. In fact some would say he became one with the rocks.

To a blind person, they sound like a rave DJ mashing-up house beats with 60\u2032s folk lyrics. To the police, it\u2019s a busy day on the sidewalk.\n\nThe Primate Fiasco uses instruments that are loud without electricity, giving them the opportunity to attack at any moment, in any location, with or without permission. No one is safe, not even an elevator or city bus. If The Primate Fiasco sees a dull moment somewhere, they will pop out of the nearest sewer drain or trash can to lead an irresistible dance party.\n\nOn stage, the sound is different. This band has pioneered what is possible with mind-bending Accordion, funky pockets of a hyperactive Sousaphone player, and banjo that thinks it\u2019s a Fender Strat. Add lyrics that grab hold of even the most inattentive audience and beats that channel surf like a remote that\u2019s been sat on. The music is always high energy and extremely imaginative. Most importantly, this is fun. People smile from the first beat to the last smoldering ash of what was previously a dance floor.\n\nFollowing a Grammy-nominated kids album, several conquered jam and electronica fests and stolen hearts at prestigious folk festivals, the Primate Fiasco audience demographic is as diverse as a New York City street. No one is safe from the Fiasco. You will smile.\"\n\nTHE ITHACA BOTTOM BOYS have been turning heads in the local and regional scene recently due to several undeniably stellar shows at last years Grassroots Music Festival in Trumansburg, and at The Blind Spots welcome home show at The Haunt this past Saint Patricks Day. \n\nDelightfully disorienting in their designated \"genre\" the Bottom Boys do their best to keep their audiences engaged, loose, and wanting more. \n\nIt was only this past Saturday that the IBB came home from their first shows out of NYS. The week was packed with unforgettably formative experiences, where they were given new opportunities to refine their sound and stage show to new calibers.\n\nDOORS at 9PM, SHOW at 9:30\nCOVER $5", "start_time": "2017-04-06T21:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Ithaca's own 250 capacity live music saloon venue. 2400 square feet with house stage/sound/backline on the Commons.\nFor booking:  booktherange@gmail.com", "name": "The Range", "emails": ["therangeithaca@gmail.com"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/17155465_440619976313113_4275122384457243958_n.jpg?oh=9048760834ee2c175461fc89efebbc74&oe=596473A3", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.49826, "state": "NY", "street": "119 E.

Come celeabrate with one of the best Grateful Dead cover bands around! Break out your colorful tie-dyes and spend the evening listening to cultural music that has withstood the test of time.\n\nBand Bio:\n\nGratefully Yours has quickly established itself as one of the Northeast\u2019s premiere Grateful Dead cover bands; with a truly all-star lineup and often performing \u201cdream\u201d set lists submitted by their fans. The band was founded in 2012 by Alex Mazur, (founding member and keyboardist of The Deadbeats\u2026 one of the, if not the longest running Grateful Dead cover bands in existence).  Along with a core lineup that includes, Adam Czolowski (Sonic Garden), Tom Pirozzi (Ominous Seapods), Jeff Martinson (Shakedown) and Rob Schiff (Nailed Shutt), other honored members include Vinnie Amico (moe.), Rob Eaton (Dark Star Orchestra), Russ Lawton (Trey Anastasio Band), Bill Carbone (Max Creek) and Zach Nugent (Cats Under The Stars).\nThe Dead were a truly unique band and had a unique bond with their audience:  Magic is what they did. Music was how they did it. Ultimately, it is that magic that Gratefully Yours aims to \u201ccover\u201d and pay tribute to. And taking it one step further, they also encourage their audience to participate further in the creative process by giving them the opportunity to submit their dream set lists (or vote for one) online and the band often chooses one to perform at their shows. But of course, you never know what might happen\u2026\n\n      St. Vith takes a modern impression on the 70's jam styles of bands such as the grateful dead. They are tuned to a intimate setting such as wineries and cafes, though they are not limited. Festivals and larger settings allow for a fuller spectrum of intensity and sound. Ever changing with guests, and environment, St. Vith provides an eclectic original and colorful experience.", "start_time": "2017-03-31T20:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Ithaca's own 250 capacity live music saloon venue. 2400 square feet with house stage/sound/backline on the Commons.\nFor booking:  booktherange@gmail.com", "name": "The Range", "emails": ["therangeithaca@gmail.com"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/17155465_440619976313113_4275122384457243958_n.jpg?oh=9048760834ee2c175461fc89efebbc74&oe=596473A3", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.49826, "state": "NY", "street": "119 E.

Sibley Hall)\n\nGerardo Francisco Sandoval is an associate professor in the Department of Planning, Public Policy, and Management at the University of Oregon. His research focuses on the roles of immigrants in community regeneration, the urban planning interventions of governments in low-income immigrant communities, and the transnational relationships that exists within immigrant neighborhoods. Sandoval's books include Immigrants and the Revitalization of Los Angeles: Development and Change in MacArthur Park, which received honorable mention for ACSP's Paul Davidoff Award, and Biking Justice and Urban Transformations: Biking for All? Sandoval has published in journals focused on urban planning and community development such as the Journal of Planning Education and Research, Urban Studies, Community Development, and the Journal of Urbanism. He received his Ph.D. in city and regional planning from the University of California\u2013Berkeley.\n\nAbstract:\n\nSandoval examines how four Latino low-income neighborhoods resist gentrification pressures as large-scale, transit-oriented, redevelopment projects threaten these neighborhoods. The study is situated within debates of transportation justice and urban cultural identity politics. The consequent transformation of these transit-oriented development projects to incorporate equity concerns and issues of cultural identity provides avenues for mitigating gentrification concerns in the neighborhoods. The neighborhoods studied are the Fruitvale in Oakland, Boyle Heights and MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, and Logan Heights in San Diego. These in-depth neighborhood case studies contribute to the planning field as planners grapple with conflicts generated via their public transit and \"affordable housing\" investments in low-income ethnic neighborhoods.

His research focuses on the roles of immigrants in community regeneration, the urban planning interventions of governments in low-income immigrant communities, and the transnational relationships that exist within immigrant neighborhoods. Sandoval's books include Immigrants and the Revitalization of Los Angeles: Development and Change in MacArthur Park, which received honorable mention for ACSP's Paul Davidoff Award; and Biking Justice and Urban Transformations: Biking for All? Sandoval has published in journals focused on urban planning and community development such as the Journal of Planning Education and Research, Urban Studies, Community Development, and the Journal of Urbanism. He received his Ph.D. in city and regional planning from the University of California\u2013Berkeley.\n\nAbstract:\n\nSandoval examines four Latino barrios resisting gentrification pressures as large-scale, transit\u2013oriented redevelopment projects threaten their neighborhoods. This study is situated within debates of transportation justice and urban cultural identity politics. Sandoval argues that contemporary Latino neighborhood anti-gentrification movements are a form of continuity of cultural practices and political resistance to an emerging reorganization of struggles over forms of collective consumption. These social urban movements, influenced by cultural identity, represent a continuation of historical struggles within the Latino barrio to reassert control over their neighborhoods by creating spaces for meaningful participation in the development process and hence encourage opportunities for community investments and benefits. Sandoval situates this argument in a multiple-site case study in California where he examines the role that Latino ethnic community identity plays in unifying these barrios. The barrios include the Fruitvale in Oakland, Boyle Heights and MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, and Barrio Logan in San Diego. The stories of resistance and struggles that emerged from these threatened barrios provide a deeper understanding of the role cultural identity plays in shaping contemporary anti-gentrification social movements. This study demonstrates how barrio residents use Latino cultural identity as a tool for resistance, for political mobilization, and as symbolic territory to create spaces for meaningful participation in the urban planning and development process to sustain their barrios.\n\nThurs., Nov. 17, 4:30 p.m.\n115 W.

Sibley Hall\n\nZhi Liu is director of the China Program at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and of Peking University \u2013 Lincoln Institute Center for Urban Development and Land Policy in Beijing, China. Previously as a lead infrastructure specialist at the World Bank, he had many years of operational experience mainly in East Asia and South Asia, where he managed investment lending projects and analytical and advisory activities in the infrastructure and urban sectors. Before joining the World Bank, he was a research associate with the Harvard Institute for International Development. He also taught city and regional planning as a faculty member at Nanjing University. He has authored and coauthored a number of academic papers and World Bank reports on various topics including metropolitan infrastructure financing, low-carbon city development, municipal finance, sustainable urban transport, motorization, and poverty and transport. He holds a B.S. from Zhongshan University, an M.S. from Nanjing University, and a Ph.D. in urban planning from Harvard University. In 2015\u201316, he served as a member of the Expert Committee for China's 13th Five-Year National Social and Economic Development Plan.\n\nAbstract:\nUrban public space is a social space that is generally open and accessible to people on a daily basis. It is not only a key element of city livability but also a contributor to the land and housing property values. This is confirmed by a host of empirical studies. However, a significant missing element in China's cityscape is public space. This neglect can be traced back to the historical city plans where public spaces for urban living and leisure are rarely found. But why are public spaces still missing in modern city planning practices? Why do public spaces disappear while both the urban government and real estate developers attempt to maximize land and housing property values? In this presentation, Liu will argue that urban public spaces fall victim to the land-based financing practices due not only to the absence of a government process to safeguard public interests, but also to a lack of understanding of the linkages between public spaces, value creation, and municipal finance. Liu will also discuss the possibilities of introducing value capture mechanisms into China's urban planning and financing.  \n\nCosponsored by the Department of City and Regional Planning and the Cornell Contemporary China Initiative of the East Asia Program\n\nMORE: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/zhi-liu-public-space-value-creation-and-sustainable-municipal-finance-new-agenda-chinese\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CornellEastAsiaProgram/", "start_time": "2016-10-25T12:20:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c200.0.200.200/p200x200/14666234_1138935589522559_682251426929420727_n.jpg?oh=d807b1849f239bed490fb77065a18bd7&oe=594F1D63", "end_time": "2016-10-25T14:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p240x240/14712733_1138935589522559_682251426929420727_o.jpg?oh=192ba47cb38b249700781d76faa668b4&oe=595D86FA", "time_from_now": -1491205258.0, "type": "public", "id": "1375556635803000", "name": "Zhi Liu: Public Space, Value Creation, and Sustainable Municipal"}, {"category": "ART_EVENT", "distance": 1517.3990724043456, "stats": {"attending": 122, "noreply": 483, "declined": 0, "maybe": 18}, "description": "The Downtown Ithaca Alliance is excited to celebrate the opening of its sixteenth annual Art in the Heart public art exhibit with a reception and tour on Friday, July 10 from 5:30-7:00 PM in Press Bay Alley (118 West Green Street.) \n \nThe reception, beginning at 5:30 PM, will feature free locally baked cupcakes, free beer tastings by Bacchus Brewing Company, and circus performances by Circus Culture.

Apple Harvest Festival is a great introduction to the rich farm and artist community of Ithaca.  First time visitors will witness a variety of wonderful local entertainers while also visiting the historical outdoor-pedestrian shopping mall, The Ithaca Commons. The pedestrian mall is the epicenter of the festival and the gateway to a nostalgic journey to harvest season fun!\n \nThe delicacies of the region are at every turn with over 100 vendors, over 50 different artists, and local farmers, who will be selling unique apple varieties, hot apple cider donuts, kettle corn, handmade arts and crafts including jewelry, ceramics and more, local farm fresh baked goods and a multitude of around the world specialties. This variety of goods is something you will not want to miss!\n\nNew Attractions:\nThe CSMA East End Entertainment Area is a new addition for 2013. This fun filled area, chock full of Amish baked goods, local harvest season produce, beer and wine tasting, and a main performance stage, is a new exploration into the local charm of downtown Ithaca.  Strong local performers take the stage by day to bring us wonderful dance, song and unique street performances for the duration of the festival.  In the evening on Saturday, October 5, entertainment such as The Alash Ensemble and masters of Tuvan throat singing can be found between 8pm \u2013 11pm inside the CSMA as part of their 6th Annual Arts for All Marathon!\nThe Aurora Street Fairway introduces a fun filled children\u2019s play area to The Apple Harvest Festival.  This wonderful street fair, located on the 200 block of North Aurora Street, is a timeless journey down memory lane.  Here you can get lost in the charm of waiting for a turn on the ferris wheel, tasting homemade ice cream, or watching street performers. Family fun may even result in a charity fund raising \u201c pie in the face\u201d for a local student group.\n\n\nPast Favorites:\nYour favorites can still be found in 2013 with added flair at each new hub.  Tasty treats and artistic ware can still be found on the West End of the Commons by the State Theater.  There\u2019s a new sound stage to be found on the steps of the State Theatre. Farm goods galore can be found at the new CSMA East End Entertainment Area, while families and children are encouraged to visit the Aurora Street Fairway to enjoy candy apples, jugglers and the ferris wheel.\n\n\n2013 Location\nThe festival takes place in the heart of Downtown Ithaca.  It starts on the 100 W. Block of State Street and continues through the Commons east toward Cornell University. The walking path of the festival takes you by the large mural project in the Commons of over 200 different art pieces by local organizations and artists. It also leads you by the historic State Theatre, Ithaca Commons, Restaurant Row, and the Community School of Music and Arts (CSMA).\nThe festival will have an additional entertainment area added this year.  It is on the east end of the Commons by the CSMA.  Here you will find a variety of farm goods, children\u2019s entertainment and a new sound stage for performance. As the Commons undergoes a historic transformation, we are expanding the footprint of the festival. \nFriday\n\nSTATE STAGE\n1:00- 1:45 Rad Howland-Bolton\n2:00-2:45 Evan D.

URS '89), since April 2011, has served as the Gensler Family Sesquicentennial Executive Director of AAP NYC, where he administers the program on behalf of its three departments. Balder led the effort to plan, design, and build the new New York City studio that opened in spring 2015, and helped to advance AAP's Executive Education Program, which was initiated that summer. He also teaches two graduate-level courses on urban planning/professional practice each fall.\n\nPrior to joining Cornell, Balder was global practice leader for Gensler's planning and urban design group, focusing on master planning for academic, cultural, waterfront, and mixed-use projects. His expertise includes project management and community facilitation. Balder's public sector experience includes twelve years at the New York City Economic Development Corporation, where he served three mayors (Dinkins, Giuliani, and Bloomberg), and he was executive vice president for real estate development whose mission is to promote the redevelopment of city-owned assets in all five boroughs. Before moving to New York City full-time, he worked for Ithaca Neighborhood Housing Services and was the founding director of the Mutual Housing Association of Tompkins County.\n\nBalder received his bachelor of science in urban and regional studies from Cornell University and is a member of the Urban Land Institute and the American Planning Association. He is also cochair of the New York City Waterfront Committee.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe fall 2016 semester marks the 10th anniversary of AAP NYC. The program is a part of Cornell's larger initiative to establish a greater academic presence in New York City. In the past decade, AAP NYC has dramatically expanded its reach by renewing alumni relationships, increasing the number of academic internships, and providing students with opportunities for full-time employment. In his lecture, Balder will highlight the roots of the AAP NYC program from the 1960s to today, including critical steps to its renewal in 2006. In addition, core elements of the academic programs will be covered, especially the development and spring 2015 opening of the new studio in the historic Standard Oil Building in lower Manhattan. He will also emphasize how students in the Master of Regional Planning (M.R.P.) program have benefited from their study of New York City in the Urban Design Studio and Urban Planning Workshop, as well as their overall participation in the program.", "start_time": "2016-12-02T12:20:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/14639692_1174826659266785_3502488499151934646_n.jpg?oh=91815cf60ac12f86e6b0c8a7db494714&oe=59907837", "end_time": "2016-12-02T14:00:00-0500", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14639692_1174826659266785_3502488499151934646_n.jpg?oh=4009ced692112af693478f61d5de312d&oe=598FD8BC", "time_from_now": -1491205412.0, "type": "public", "id": "1122836581098718", "name": "Robert Balder: AAP NYC: Lessons Learned 2006\u201316"}, {"category": "LECTURE", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 1, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 3}, "description": "Lance Freeman is a professor in the urban planning program at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation.

His focus on black ghettos outside the 11 states that were a part of the Confederacy because Jim Crow and the later industrial development of the South make the Southern ghetto prior to the Civil Rights movement distinctive and worthy of separate treatment. The talk will tell the story of black agency with regard to the ghetto \u2014 how blacks reacted to ghettoization, how they perceived the ghetto, and the actions they took to flee and/or protect the ghetto. Although a voluminous literature tells the story of how whites, acting individually, collectively, and with the assistance of public policy created and maintained the modern American ghetto, this literature tends to treat blacks as mere bystanders who acquiesced to ghettoization.\n\nMore here:\nhttps://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/lance-freeman-haven-and-hell-evolving-role-ghetto-black-america\n\nOctober 27, 2016, 4:30 p.m. \n115 W.

The panels are expected to go up around mid-April. Each of these will be painted with white primer and given over to a different individual or group to turn into a temporary mural. These murals will convey the diverse creative talents of our community and will be a fascinating public display for locals and tourists alike. \n\nThe DIA is now accepting proposals for these murals from any local artist, art student, arts organization, non-profit, school group, family or individual. The theme is up to the individual, but the panels must be suitable for a public outdoor setting and should reflect the best values and qualities of our community. Prizes include a grand prize of a $500 Downtown Gift Card, plus a range of other gift card prizes, and a pizza and ice cream party for the best group. Property owners, businesses, and organizations within the Ithaca Downtown Business Improvement District are encouraged to participate. \n\nApplications are available at downtownithaca.com and can be filled in online or downloaded as a PDF. Applications will be accepted until April 29 or until all of the panels are adopted.  Participants will be notified of their panel location by May 3. Painting of the murals will take place starting May 4 and must be completed by May 30, the Unveiling Party and Awards Ceremony on Thursday of the Ithaca Festival.  The project will also be featured during First Friday Gallery Night on June 7.\n\nApplications will be evaluated by a selection committee comprised of DIA staff members and community arts professionals.

The book, with 15 chapters and a foreword by Phillip Lopate, will be published by Princeton University Press for release in the spring of 2018.\n\nJeffrey Chusid\n\"California Modernism in India: Insights from the work and life of Joseph Allen Stein.\" Joseph Allen Stein was an American architect, with a growing practice in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1940s that he abandoned in the face of the anti-Communist Black List to start a new life in India. By the early 1960s, he had a thriving and influential firm producing major works that are still much appreciated today in his adopted homeland. His political and social interests were central to his life and work, as they were for many modernists, although today we may interpret the results from the stance of a critique of neocolonialism and globalism. \n\nJohn Forester\n\"How Planners Improvise: Stories of New Orleans and Holland.\" Rebuilding Community After Katrina (with Ken Reardon) tells the story of how Cornell's planning department partnered with a strong grassroots community organization, ACORN, to address the devastation and plan for the recovery of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans after the disaster of Katrina and failed levees. Conflict, Improvisation, Governance (with David Laws) shows how diverse \"street level democrats\" (planners, community workers, housing association staff, and others) translate policy intentions into actual policy practices in fluid, messy, ambiguous, contentious contexts that demand not only yesterday's techniques and visions but today's improvisation and creative responsiveness to unique settings.\n\nWilliam W. Goldsmith\n\"Saving Our Cities: A Progressive Plan to Transform Urban America.\" Saving Our Cities shows how cities can be places of opportunity rather than places with problems. With strongly revived cities and suburbs, working as places that serve all their residents, metropolitan areas will thrive, thus making the national economy more productive, the environment better protected, the citizenry better educated, and the society more reflective, sensitive, and humane. Goldsmith argues that America has been in the habit of abusing its cities and their poorest suburbs, which are always the first to be blamed for society's ills and the last to be helped. As federal and state budgets, regulations, and programs line up with the interests of giant corporations and privileged citizens, they impose austerity on cities, shortchange public schools, make it hard to get nutritious food, and inflict the drug war on unlucky neighborhoods.\n\nOctober 21, 2016, 12:20 p.m., Milstein Auditorium, Cornell University\n\nMORE: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/campanella-chusid-forester-goldsmith-crp-faculty-book-authors", "start_time": "2016-10-21T12:20:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c9.0.200.200/p200x200/14724366_1138925249523593_4789294228824533513_n.jpg?oh=e1b51e715ce58f1d0d37c86c132f3552&oe=59656D87", "end_time": "2016-10-21T13:30:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14724366_1138925249523593_4789294228824533513_n.jpg?oh=59304872d50405d9246559ed538938d9&oe=595EAB86", "time_from_now": -1491205242.0, "type": "public", "id": "316668082037314", "name": "Campanella, Chusid, Forester, Goldsmith: CRP Faculty Book Author"}, {"category": null, "distance": 1517.3990724043456, "stats": {"attending": 64, "noreply": 297, "declined": 0, "maybe": 18}, "description": "Free- Parade, Trick or Treating, Refreshments & Games\n\nCommunity Halloween Parade:\nThursday, October 31st join the Community Halloween Parade starting at the Greater Ithaca Activities Center (301 W.

Her research focuses on poverty and racial inequality in American politics. More specifically, her work explores two overarching themes: the conditions under which economically and racially disadvantaged groups engage in the political process, and the role of the state in shaping the political and economic trajectories of marginalized communities. Centering on these concerns, her research has been supported by the Ford Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nAbstract:\n\nGeographically concentrated disadvantage is a key mechanism through which inequities are proliferated. The spatial patterning of disadvantage renders it more than the sum of its individual parts and disproportionately harms economically and racially marginalized Americans. This lecture focuses specifically on place-based political disadvantages that emerge when Medicaid beneficiaries are highly concentrated in particular communities. Drawing on an aggregate longitudinal data set (2000\u201410), Michener analyzes the impact of Medicaid density on county level voter turnout, voter choice, and non-profit organizational strength. Employing several carefully specified regression models, she shows that as the proportion of county residents utilizing Medicaid increases, civic and political membership associations decline, as do aggregate rates of voting. These findings suggest that policymakers and grassroots organizations would do well to consider place-based strategies for addressing the demobilizing political effects of unevenly concentrated people-based policies.\n\nNovember 10, 2016, 4:30 p.m.\n115 W.

'08, Ph.D. CRP '11) is an assistant professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Colorado Denver. His research centers on community risk and resilience to natural hazards and climate change in the U.S. and India. His work has appeared in numerous planning and development journals including the Journal of the American Planning Association, Habitat International, the Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, and the Journal of Planning Education and Research. His recent projects include a community-based study of earthquake and landslide risk in the hill station cities of northeastern India, and an NSF-funded project examining uneven recovery from the 2013 floods in Colorado.\n\nAbstract:\nCities in India are increasingly vulnerable to flooding. In Kolkata, urban development in the low-lying fringe has produced new geographies of disaster and is leading to a seemingly inexorable conflict between the city and its future environment. This lecture will connect the proximate conditions of vulnerability and flood risk in peri-urban Kolkata to their root causes, focusing on the politics of spatial development and the unequal provision of housing and urban infrastructure. It will discuss how these roots of risk are shaping disaster geographies elsewhere in urban India and argue that disaster and climate change plans must grapple with the real politics of development to be effective tools for building urban resilience.\n\nOctober 18, 2016, 5:30 p.m., Milstein Auditorium, Cornell University", "start_time": "2016-10-18T17:30:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/14731172_1138904102859041_3518998770486482464_n.jpg?oh=e2ff1db94502fe6bcda2f0735f296131&oe=599601D6", "end_time": "2016-10-18T19:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14731172_1138904102859041_3518998770486482464_n.jpg?oh=a52b9fb6774290be6d2e2dbedeb14dec&oe=59527F5D", "time_from_now": -1491205230.0, "type": "public", "id": "1133085846778274", "name": "Andrew Rumbach: Marshes, Malls, and the Land Mafia"}, {"category": "LECTURE", "distance": 563.8599327104238, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "Cornell in Rome - Fall 2016 Lecture Series\n\nGiuseppe Piccioni plays an important role in the generation of directors who have brought Italian cinema back into worldwide prominence since the end of last century. After studying at the Gaumont Film School from 1980\u201383, Piccioni made his directorial debut in 1987 with Il grande Blek, which won the De Sica Award for the best new Italian film of the year. The film was screened at that year's Berlin Film Festival and also won the Nastro d'Argento.\n\nPiccioni's next film, Chiedi la luna, won a Grolla d'oro for best director and was selected for the 1991 Venice Film Festival. Piccioni established himself internationally in 1999 with his film Fuori dal mondo (Not of this world) that won five David di Donatello awards. The film garnered four Ciaks d'Oro as well as the Special Grand Prize of the Jury Award at Montreal.\n\nIn 2001 Piccioni released Light of my eyes (Luce dei miei occhi). This film focuses on ordinary characters who are \"castaways, always just about to lose their way, inadequate, losers, afflicted by average unhappiness, travelers through life, visitors to the world.\" In 2004 he made La vita che vorrei, with the same acting duo of Lo Cascio-Ceccarelli who had won at the Venice Film Festival for their interpretation of Light of my eyes.\n\nWith Giulia non esce la sera (2009), the director returned to his most authentic inspiration: investigations, conducted with delicacy and subdued tones, of individuals captured in a particular moment of their lives. His last film, Il rosso e Il blu, was released in 2012 and is set in an Italian high school.\n\nPiccioni has worked with many of the most important Italian actors, including Margherita Buy, Silvio Orlando, Luigi Lo Cascio, Sandra Ceccarelli, Valeria Golino, and Riccardo Scamarcio.\n\nLocation: Palazzo Santacroce\nPiazza Benedetto Cairoli 6, 00186 Rome, Italy\n+39 06 689 7070\n\nMre: http://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/giuseppe-piccioni-one-most-distinctive-filmmakers-contemporary-italian-cinema", "start_time": "2016-11-17T18:00:00+0100", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c133.0.200.200/p200x200/14962760_1161260467290071_754792647653193265_n.jpg?oh=1033c5bf8551976143822344433b3f7a&oe=5967882E", "end_time": "2016-11-17T20:00:00+0100", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14962760_1161260467290071_754792647653193265_n.jpg?oh=4431e263c3524939e7b5315ac077770d&oe=59599DC8", "time_from_now": -1491205352.0, "type": "public", "id": "963287577147960", "name": "Giuseppe Piccioni: Contemporary Italian Cinema"}, {"category": "COMMUNITY", "distance": 1517.3990724043456, "stats": {"attending": 3, "noreply": 3, "declined": 0, "maybe": 30}, "description": "This fun-filled special monthly event features activities that are geared towards the community's older population, providing them with an opportunity to spend a day downtown participating in educational and entertaining activities while discovering or reacquainting themselves with downtown's offerings.

Sibley Hall\n\nArthur P. Ziegler Jr. is a leading American preservationist, urbanist, writer, and activist. He promotes historic preservation as an effective means to create sustainable affordable housing, healthy neighborhoods, and economic development. Ziegler's work has been as much about social justice for disenfranchised populations as it has been preserving important places. He is best known for creating the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (PH&LF) to combat urban renewal policies that devastated Pittsburgh \u2014 literally and spiritually \u2014 making it one of the most segregated cities in the nation. Through the PH&LF, Ziegler spearheaded the first urban renewal program in the nation based on preservation rather than demolition. PH&LF's Manchester neighborhood project was the first urban renewal project to create a preservation district within a predominantly African-American neighborhood and the first to be administered by the residents themselves. Emblematic of PH&LF's success in using historic preservation as an instrument of economic revitalization, its adaptive reuse of a former rail terminal facility at Station Square had the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s.\n\nMichael Sriprasert is president of the Landmarks Community Capital Corporation, the project financing division of PH&LF. Sriprasert has overseen many millions of dollars of reinvestment in Pittsburgh's historic neighborhoods.\n\nAbstract:\n\nHistoric preservation is among the most powerful tools planners have to create livable spaces that are truly sustainable, meaning they are not only environmentally responsible but are also socially conscious and financially sound. Under the guidance of Arthur Ziegler and Michael Sriprasert, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation has led a decades-long successful campaign to reinvigorate Pittsburgh. Ziegler and Sriprasert have used historic preservation to catalyze new development, creating affordable housing and encouraging new businesses to move to the once burned-out, historic core of one of America's great industrial cities. Their lecture will discuss their work, including strategies for success and predictions for the future.", "start_time": "2016-10-17T10:10:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/14581342_1140834809332637_712263219616218533_n.jpg?oh=f20f3a010a97d161aaf950336a317c88&oe=599342AF", "end_time": "2016-10-17T11:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14581342_1140834809332637_712263219616218533_n.jpg?oh=6333d933054442fb60409d2458e7aafb&oe=59592820", "time_from_now": -1491205225.0, "type": "public", "id": "578741008984253", "name": "Arthur P.

Experience Neo Project for yourself!\nfacebook.com/NeoProjectBand\n\nFriday September 6th - Sim Redmond Band (7-9pm) & Second Dam(6-7pm)\nSince their inception over 10 years ago, the Sim Redmond Band has been steadily on the rise, forging new ground in roots music. Traveling around the globe, playing with the likes of moe., the Neville Brothers, the Wailers, Jimmy Cliff, and Habib Koite, in some of the most beautiful venues in the U.S. and Japan, the world has taken notice. With 6 tours of Japan under their belt, SRB's unique blend of roots-rock, Afro-Carribean, and reggae music continues to spread like wild fire.\n\nThey are based in Ithaca, NY but their magnetic pole is Africa, particularly the sounds eminating from West & South Africa. This magnetic pole has served as a pivot for the Sim Redmond Band to spring into straight rock grooves and pumping reggae. The vocal teamwork of Sim Redmond, Jen Middaugh, and Nate Silas Richardson creates some of the richest harmonies you'll ever hear. For more information visit: http://www.simredmondband.com/shows.html\n\nSecond Dam is a band hailing from the lovely town of Ithaca, NY. It started from the broken bones of former musical projects that involved Kayla Sewell and KC Weston and developed when the pair met the other musicians of the band in a myriad of ways; Brian and Andrew at the school's weekly open mic's, PJ in a college a cappella group and Zack in academic scholar program.\n\"The combination of diverse instruments - electric guitars, bass guitars, string instruments, a ukulele and drums - blended together to create a sound that is difficult to categorize.\nSecond Dam has a way of making their songs suspenseful in a way that captivates the listener and commands full mental and physical attention. Their musical depth was pervasive and the crescendos of their songs reverberated wall to wall. The added vocal harmonies provided a sound that cannot be compared to any other band. Each song the band played sounded totally different from the one before. It kept the night feeling fresh, and it seemed that even people who had never heard Second Dam before were able to sing along.\"\n- Robyn Schmitz, Buzzsaw Magazine For more information visit: https://www.facebook.com/seconddam\n\nThe Summer Concert series is brought to you by>>>\nM&T Bank, Seneca Beverage Corp.

The core goal of the R3CP is to create a fundamentally different way to identify and tackle critical disaster resilience and climate change challenges that threaten communities around the world. The project has brought together faculty and students from urban planning and design, climatology, public health, and engineering to collect new data and synthesize existing information on how social and physical systems work. Two neighborhoods in inner-city Houston with a history of hazards vulnerability and environmental justice issues serve as living laboratories. R3CP believes in the importance of creating long-term change and colearning with communities to actualize their own resilience, and strives to apply the knowledge developed from the work in Houston to support research, community engagement, and educational activities throughout the U.S. and the world.\n\nOctober 25, 2016\n4:30 p.m.\nMilstein Auditorium, Cornell University", "start_time": "2016-10-25T16:30:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c127.0.200.200/p200x200/14721528_1140812196001565_4113079206795638058_n.jpg?oh=d07b0eb4a5e87acac9ea2fee895727f5&oe=59948211", "end_time": "2016-10-25T18:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14721528_1140812196001565_4113079206795638058_n.jpg?oh=6b3ec5c000bd2fe0cd21bf5c7f7218f0&oe=59502C5A", "time_from_now": -1491205258.0, "type": "public", "id": "1072129342903786", "name": "Phillip Berke: Resilience and Climate Change Cooperative Project"}, {"category": "MUSIC_EVENT", "distance": 1517.3990724043456, "stats": {"attending": 399, "noreply": 157, "declined": 0, "maybe": 21}, "description": "Free and fun for the whole family, these free performances will take place at 6:00 PM (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 9/3 AND 9/10) each Thursday between June 25 and September 10, 2015.

Considering the artist studio as a space of production and at times also of living, most artists submerged in the city gather and repurpose material from the spaces around them, both physical found objects and mental observations. Through their work, artists participate in the transformation of the urban fabric. The relationship between an artwork and the context in which it is produced is not a monolog, but a conversation wherein the two engage with each other in dialogue that subsequently changes both.\n\nThe conversation will address subjects related to the mapping of non-Euclidean spaces \u2014 whether it be a celestial or subaltern space, informal economies, or psychogeographies \u2014 investigating their effects on the produced artworks and contemplating the relationship to the spaces of production. When these non-Euclidean works are brought into proximity of architecture, how will they alter the space?\n\nThe conversation will be moderated by Visiting Lecturer Alva Mooses, followed by the launch of the limited edition publication Correspondence between NYC & P-au-P, which Mooses developed over the past year as a means of connecting artworks and writing from the two metropoles.\n\nNathalie Jolivert is a New York City\u2013based architect and artist who grew up in Port-au-Prince and received her B.F.A. and B.Arch. from RISD. While at RISD she won the Gensler National Diversity Award in 2011, which features her eco-touristic project for the indigenous Wayuu tribe of La Guajira in Colombia. Professionally, Jolivert worked on various projects with Architecture For Humanity, Studio Drum Collaborative, and the Architectural Association Visiting School in Haiti. As a painter, she also won a travel art residency to Bangladesh and Malawi which led to an exhibition at the Frontiers in Development Forum in Washington, DC (2014). Her interest in the urban fabric of Port-au-Prince led her to write an essay titled \"Bringing down the Walls,\" published in UCLA's Haiti NOW urban almanac (2015). Jolivert's design process is often inspired by local stories, which she incorporates throughout her architectural and art projects.\n\nRejin Leys is a mixed-media artist and community papermaker based in New York City. Her drawings and artist's books have been exhibited at such venues as Centro Cultural de Espana, Santo Domingo; Kentler International Drawing Space, New York City; Queens Museum, New York City; and Les Ateliers J.R. Jerome, Port-au-Prince. Her work is in the collections of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Yale University, and the Rutgers University Caribbean Studies Department. In 1995 Leys was awarded a fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts.\n\nJerry Philogene is an associate professor in the American studies and Africana studies departments at Dickinson College. She received her doctorate from New York University in American Studies. Her articles have appeared in Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism, BOMBMagazine, Radical History Review, MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States, and, most recently, Journal of Haitian Studies. She has published numerous exhibition catalog essays. She is the coeditor of a special forthcoming issue of Small Axe (March 2017) that will focus exclusively on the work of women artists from the global Caribbean. She is currently working on a manuscript, titled The Socially Dead and the 'Improbably Citizen:' Cultural Transformations of Haitian Citizenship, which provides a rich, textured analysis of the power of the visual field and its complex relationship between violence, domination, and liberation through an exploration of contemporary painting, photography, film, and comics. An award-winning teacher, Philogene was the recipient of Dickinson College's 2015 Distinguished Teaching Award.\n\nAndy Robert was born in Les Cayes, Haiti, and received his B.F.A. in painting from the Maryland Institute College of Art, and an M.F.A. from the California Institute of the Arts. Robert attended the Whitney Independent Study Program, and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. He is a recipient of the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Grant. Robert has exhibited at the Bienal de las Fronteras (Instituto Tamaulipeco papa la Cultura y las Artes) in Tamaulipas, Mexico; Papillion Art, Night Gallery, and Hannah Hoffman Gallery in Los Angeles; Dimensions Variable, Miami; and at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Robert is currently the 2016 artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem.\n\nCorrespondence between NYC & P-au-P was made possible with the generous support of the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Artist Community Engagement Grant, and the artists featured in the publication: Katelyn Alexis, Jhon Charles, Xavier Delancour, Papa Da (Alphonse Jean Junior), Dyapazon (Erntz Jeudy), Andre Eugene, Leah Gordon, Getho Jean-Baptiste, Nathalie Jolivert, Pascale Monnin, Valerie Noisette, Rasin (Joseph Fils Racine), RAM, Ruthger Richard, Claude Saintilus, @seebytouch, Felipe Baeza, Lea Cetera, Mauricio Cortes Ortega, Laura Serejo Genes, Caludio Cortinez, Richard Arthur Fleming, Frances Gallardo, Troels Steenholdt Heiredal, Samuel Jablon, Marsha Jean-Charles, Rejin Leys, Daniel Simidor, Jerry Lim, Alva Mooses, Andrew Cornell Robinson, and Kantara Souffrant.", "start_time": "2016-11-04T18:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=b1cc9fd3cccd2321156aceea0d66e7cb&oe=595FE535", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/17554490_1323702451045871_3113617142948684663_n.jpg?oh=d0819df5dd8fda076d37bc5ca6a15e23&oe=5990CCF7", "id": "224657934283667"}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/14606263_1154576167958501_7576485478535575759_n.jpg?oh=29790ded2cb0543c023ca9faa021c3a2&oe=59927D04", "end_time": "2016-11-04T19:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14606263_1154576167958501_7576485478535575759_n.jpg?oh=b007ee2406bf6bb6b296cf5c9dab0368&oe=5958588F", "time_from_now": -1491205298.0, "type": "public", "id": "205282619896669", "name": "Dialogue and Publication Launch: Correspondence between NYC & P-"}, {"category": "SHOPPING", "distance": 1517.3990724043456, "stats": {"attending": 247, "noreply": 33, "declined": 0, "maybe": 17}, "description": "Join us for the Downtown Ithaca Summer Sale, July 30 - August 2.

Weinstein's diverse background includes theater, acting, film, screenwriting, and painting. Weinstein works extensively in 3D animation and transfers the technical and narrative concerns of this medium into an art world still unaccustomed to its presence. Weinstein has assembled a small animation production community that assists in the production of his work. Weinstein creates fully realized 3D animated characters, writes dialogue and songs for them, and then works with actors and musicians to bring them to life. Commercial media production processes are mirrored in Weinstein's work, which functions simultaneously as critique and participant in the culture industry by using commercial processes (computer animation, vinyl stencils, airbrush, metal patination, metal casting) to embody hyper-subjective content. Taking the phenomenological concept of world uncovering to personal extremes, Weinstein uncovers a polymath, creatively integrated and always transforming aesthetic cosmos.\n\nWeinstein has exhibited at the new Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, the Kunsthalle in Vienna, the Matisse Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Denver Museum, and the Hirshhorn Museum among others; as well as many U.S. and international galleries. He recently completed an animation project with the Charlotte, North Carolina symphony. An upcoming project is a 20-minute film based on the writings of British stream of consciousness writer Anna Kavan. This piece will be the first project within Cornell Tech's program Art Foo, in which a computer programmer elevates the technological possibilities of a media artist over a six-month period.

What started with 300 white blank wooden panels has now transformed into pieces of art reflecting the best qualities of our community. Panels were completed by area artists, community groups, children, families, non-profit organizations and downtown businesses. \n\nThe Art Mural project was sponsored by the Tompkins Trust Company and the Downtown Ithaca Alliance. The Ithaca Commons construction project began in April of 2013 and is scheduled to be completed in July of 2014. The project was conceived to bring color, vibrancy, and a sense of ownership of the demolition process to the community.\n\nThe art opening will feature speaking on the East end of the commons hosted by the Downtown Ithaca Alliance and the art mural exhibit will be officially opened by City of Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick at 5pm.\n\nThere will be a self-guided mural tour around the Commons, interspersed with music and street performance. There will also be free popcorn, snow cones, and cotton candy available to tour participants. Face painting and balloons will be available for the kids or the young at heart. \n\nParticipants can vote for their favorite mural art to assist in crowning the prize winners in the People\u2019s Choice competition. Ballots for voting will be available as well as walking tour maps at the information tent on North Aurora Street on the East End of the Ithaca Commons.  Mural artists will have the chance to win a $500 Downtown Gift Card (Best in Show), a variety of other prizes, and the best group mural will win a free pizza and ice cream party. \n\nThis event is free to the public and very family friendly.  Those who wish to participate can park in one of the three parking garages located downtown on Green, Seneca, or Cayuga street. Remember, parking is free at Downtown meters after 6pm and in the garages after 8pm.  \n\nFor more information about downtown Ithaca, visit downtownithaca.com or call 607-277-8679.", "start_time": "2013-06-21T17:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "The Downtown Ithaca Alliance welcomes you to Downtown Ithaca where you can shop, dine, work, and play.

She was awarded the Special Prize of the Gold Medal of Italian Architecture in 2012 and in 2006 for Education, the In Opera Award 2012, the Selection in the European Mies van der Rohe Award 2009, the Sfide 2009 Prize of the Italian Ministry of Landscape and Environment, the FarbDesignPreis 2009 honorable mention, and the AR+D Award 2008 honorable mention.\n\nSegantini was recently invited to exhibit at the 15th International Architecture Exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Her works have been published internationally and presented at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; in the eighth, 12th, 13th, and 14th Venice biennales of architecture; and at MIT in Boston, the Triennale of Milan, the Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019Architecture et du Patrimoine in Paris, the Architekturzentrum in Wien, and the RIBA in London, among others.\n\nSegantini has lectured at several prestigious international universities such as Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation; Cornell and Syracuse universities; RISD; Cambridge University and the University of Bath in the U.K.; Hasselt University in Belgium; Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia in Venice; the universities of Alghero, Ferrara, and Roma La Sapienza in Italy; and Moratowa University in Colombo, Sri Lanka. She is also a visiting professor at MIT.\n\nAbstract:\n\nMost of the places C+S Architects has visited and chosen to design preserve traces manifesting concepts that heritage values have resisted. In some cases, these appear as strong, permanent, and consolidated features. In others, they appear just as a thin filigree.\n\nC+S Architects approaches the places they decide to design in a similar way to how translators approach the texts they love \u2014 by investigating, listening, and building within them an empathetic dialogue, while bridging them to a different time.\n\nWhat the firm has defined as translation architecture is more of a dialogue suspended in time, a disciplined sensitivity towards the contexts, which informs and conforms to the chosen spaces.\n\nThe designs of C+S Architects critically evaluate the context, understanding the potential energy of the built and unbuilt environment, and the people searching for moments of accumulation of value, knowledge, and desire.

Michael Goldsmith Lecture\n\nWeiss/Manfredi's enduring interest in an expanded territory for architecture, freed from the constraints of disciplinary boundaries, informs the trajectory of their practice. Their multidisciplinary work focuses on creating more productive connections between architecture, landscape, infrastructure, and art. During the L. Michael Goldsmith Lecture at AAP NYC, cofounders Marion Weiss and Michael Manfredi (M.Arch. '80) will provide an overview of their recent work and introduce a current project, The Bridge, a building on Cornell Tech's groundbreaking new Roosevelt Island campus. As the first colocation center on the campus, this building defines a new programmatic typology that fuses entrepreneurial and academic ambitions.\n\nWeiss/Manfredi's projects are noted for clarity of vision, bold and iconic forms, and material innovation. Notable projects include the Seattle Art Museum: Olympic Sculpture Park, the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Visitor Center, the Singh Center for Nanotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania, the Barnard College Diana Center, and the recently completed Kent State Center for Architecture and Environmental Design. In addition to The Bridge, the firm is currently designing the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India.\n\nThe firm's work has been recognized with an Academy Award for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Architectural League's Emerging Voices Award, and the New York AIA Gold Medal. Their work has been exhibited internationally at the Museum of Modern Art, the Venice Architecture Biennale, the Louvre, and the Guggenheim Museum. Princeton Architectural Press has published three monographs on their work: WEISS/MANFREDI: Surface/Subsurface, Site Specific, and, most recently, Public Natures.\n\nManfredi is a senior design critic at Harvard University and Weiss is the Graham Chair Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Design. They have also taught design studios at Cornell University, Yale University as the Eero Saarinen Visiting Professors, Harvard University, and Princeton University. Both are fellows of the AIA and National Academy inductees.\n\nLECTURE April 19, 6 p.m.\nAAP NYC - 26 Broadway, 20th floor, New York City 10004 \n\nMore: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/marion-weiss-and-michael-manfredi-converging-territories", "start_time": "2017-04-19T18:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "id": "224657934283667", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=7395ef7e1807dc9e8fb78d08ac714506&oe=59877235", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q84/p240x240/17835155_1336339136448869_856103476589123762_o.jpg?oh=80a38d5ba73b5df54e349d4215a4571e&oe=5983C957", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"]}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c109.0.200.200/p200x200/17861778_1337726969643419_7911915036877547296_n.jpg?oh=5f8764cde2a92a4a72bb1659a70f7854&oe=598FDF21", "end_time": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17861778_1337726969643419_7911915036877547296_n.jpg?oh=51796658fa2f743ad2e854a1f1f869aa&oe=598383AA", "time_from_now": -1492487792.0, "type": "public", "id": "216733295478280", "name": "Marion Weiss & Michael A.

K. Burns is an interdisciplinary artist and educator living in Brooklyn. Burns is currently at work on a cycle of video installations that takes speculative fiction as a point of departure. The work follows a long-standing interest in the body as a site of cultural and political negotiation. Using video, sculpture, drawing, and collaboration, Burns queries the relationship between materiality and language in order to rework economies of gender, labor, ecology, and sexuality.\n\nThe opening episode from the cycle of works, A Smeary Spot (2015), debuted at Participant Inc. in New York City in the fall of 2015 and was also exhibited at Portland Institute for Contemporary Art, Oregon, in 2016. This spring, Burns is exhibiting three consecutive solo shows including an exhibition of the next video installation in the cycle, Living Room (2017), at The New Museum in New York City. Related works including a recorded album and poem, Leave No Trace (2016), are on exhibit at Callicoon Fine Arts, New York City. An exhibition titled No Time, No Place, No Body that draws on works from over a decade of Burns's practice is on exhibit at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nA self-described \"compulsive collaborator,\" Burns cofounded W.A.G.E (Working Artists in the Great Economy) \u2014 an artists' advocacy group \u2014 in 2008 and remains a life-long advocate for labor issues in the arts. Burns also coedited Randy, an annual transfeminist arts magazine, from 2010 to 2013 and released a compendium publication in June 2016. Working in collaboration with A. L. Steiner, she produced Community Action Center (2010), a feature-length, intergenerational, socio-sexual video portrait, intended to reimage and imagine pornographic cinema. The work has been screened at numerous venues internationally including the Tate Modern in London and MoMA in New York City. Additionally, Burns maintains an ongoing collaborative practice with her partner Katherine Hubbard. Their most recent project, The Poetry Parade\u2026, is a series of live literary interventions in permanent collections that have been staged at several New York City museums including The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and MoMA.\n\nCurrently, Burns is a 2016\u201317 Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University. She was a recipient of a 2015 Creative Capital Foundation Visual Arts Award and is represented by Callicoon Fine Arts and Video Data Bank.\n\nBurns will focus her talk on her current exhibitions and elaborate on how camping in Utah, new materialism, access to resources, a disdain for speed and newness, the current political apocalypse, collaboration, and previous projects have influenced the development of this most recent body of work.\n\nLECTURE\nApril 13, 5:15 p.m.\nAbby and Howard Milstein Auditorium, Milstein Hall\nhttps://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/k-burns-slow-rearrangement-desires", "start_time": "2017-04-13T17:15:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "id": "224657934283667", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=7395ef7e1807dc9e8fb78d08ac714506&oe=59877235", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q84/p240x240/17835155_1336339136448869_856103476589123762_o.jpg?oh=80a38d5ba73b5df54e349d4215a4571e&oe=5983C957", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"]}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c11.0.200.200/p200x200/17553927_1321787847903998_1517992115362604516_n.jpg?oh=4c608f6db50440cdf23bbeebaa9cb859&oe=5980E282", "end_time": "2017-04-13T18:30:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17553927_1321787847903998_1517992115362604516_n.jpg?oh=4be991c02d38d371778341135f0f3c5e&oe=594EF043", "time_from_now": -1492487778.0, "type": "public", "id": "142973272897342", "name": "A.

She was an assistant professor at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Politecnico di Milano, and Universit\u00e0 di Bologna. Since 2001, she has been an associate professor in architectural and urban composition at the Universit\u00e0 di Bologna; she is also the deputy director of the Department of Architecture and was the coordinator of the Ph.D. program in architecture until 2016.\n\nTrentin does research and teaches architectural design at the School of Engineering and Architecture, mainly investigating the relationship between theory and architecture of the 20th century. In this field, she has also conducted research on engineering and architecture, focusing her attention on the relationship between theory and practice and on the value of structural design.\n\nCurrently, Trentin coordinates an international research group on the figure of Pier Luigi Nervi, in cooperation with Centro Studi e Archivio della Comunicazione dell'Universit\u00e0 di Parma, MAXXI Museum, and Princeton University. For several years, with the support of the Ungers Archiv f\u00fcr Architekturwissenschaft Cologne, she has studied the theoretical work of Oswald Mathias Ungers.\n\nShe is the author of many projects, essays, and several books, including Oswald Mathias Ungers, una scuola (2004) La lezione di Aldo Rossi (2008); La lezione di Pier Luigi Nervi (2010); and Architettura e Costruzione: La declinazione strutturale da Gustave Eiffel a Rem Koolhaas (2016).\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis lecture focuses on the relationship between structural engineering and architecture, through two fundamental aspects of construction: the scientific and the humanistic. In particular, the vision that Trentin would like to convey is the contribution that structural engineering can make to architecture in terms of conceptual engineering, through its various interpretations and with the consequent expressive potential of joint work between engineer and architect. This topic, which tends to identify the structural interpretations in architectural construction, is developed in full awareness that structural thinking does not necessarily constitute the only architectural interpretation. Instead, this research seeks to understand how structures can speak and how they can give cultural value to buildings.

Their Art teacher is Judy Cogan. The inspiration for the project came from contemporary artist Sandra Silberzweig. She is known for her whimsical, abstract portraits that are full of color, pattern and symbolism. Students looked at many of her paintings and discussed the strategies the artist used over and over again to create her unique style. They made a list of the qualities she has a habit of using, including:\n\nBright color\nUse of patterns\nShapes of the eyes, nose and mouth\nConnectedness of facial features\nLarger than life portraits\nCropped faces\nSymbols that convey the theme of the artwork\n\nThen, the students worked step by step with Judy to draw the major components of the face: the eyes, nose, mouth, head and neck outlines. Once the basics were in place, students were encouraged to use the strategies Silberzweig uses to complete the artwork. They focused on color, pattern and symbolism, and used layered and blended colored pastels, not stopping until they had filled the entire page. We used black paper to make the colors as brilliant as possible. The results are stunning\u2026.powerful, thoughtful and imaginative. \n\n Join us as we celerate their work at our East Hill Plaza Location!", "start_time": "2017-04-11T09:30:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "High-quality, unique and delicious food and beverages.

Her expertise in housing policy, neighborhood planning, urban and planning history, and historic preservation has resulted in numerous publications including peer-reviewed articles for Housing Studies, Housing Policy Debate, Urban Studies, Planning Perspectives, and Planning History. Her most recent publication, Community Architect: The Life and Vision of Clarence S. Stein (Cornell University Press, 2016), examines this significant transitional figure's ground-breaking concepts from site design to housing finance and management. As part of a collaborative research team, she drafted one of the first state-wide studies to assess historic preservation and its contributions to quality of life. She has also participated on a multidisciplinary research team that developed a flexible spatial model to identify and assess the suitability of sites for affordable housing development and preservation. Her dynamic leadership in the dual roles of department chair and school director included spearheading the development of the first online graduate program in urban and regional planning in the U.S.\n\nAbstract:\n\nClarence Stein's iconic new town of Radburn, New Jersey, is now a historic landmark. Many of his ideas \u2014 particularly the \"modernization\" of the Garden City in the late 1920s and early 1930s for the \"motor age\" \u2014 are relegated to the history books. Yet critical elements of Stein's community proposals resonate with planners, landscape architects, architects, and developers today, whether they know it or not. The low-income housing tax credit program integrates elements of what Stein called \"investment housing\" \u2013 quality design at a reasonable return targeted at working class residents. His signature community designs \u2014 weaving together private gardens with a hierarchy of public parks \u2014 represent a sophisticated understanding of open space design evident today in green infrastructure. From new mortgage instruments to broaden home ownership to public-private partnerships, Stein's influence endures. This presentation elaborates on themes from Larsen's recently published book, Community Architect: The Life and Vision of Clarence S. Stein.\n\nLECTURE: April 14, 12:20 p.m.\nAbby and Howard Milstein Auditorium, Milstein Hall", "start_time": "2017-04-14T12:20:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "name": "Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning", "id": "224657934283667", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12744619_960867480662705_5376428675587936487_n.jpg?oh=7395ef7e1807dc9e8fb78d08ac714506&oe=59877235", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.48891, "state": "NY", "street": "129 Sibley Dome Cornell University", "latitude": 42.44847}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q84/p240x240/17835155_1336339136448869_856103476589123762_o.jpg?oh=80a38d5ba73b5df54e349d4215a4571e&oe=5983C957", "emails": ["aapcommunications@cornell.edu"]}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p200x200/17554150_1321749411241175_908229156083821874_n.jpg?oh=541ac7cc737c83b572ba365be073b65d&oe=5986BB74", "end_time": "2017-04-14T13:30:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/17554150_1321749411241175_908229156083821874_n.jpg?oh=6cfc4ff9815933c7402f1b3bd2e1ff35&oe=5994668B", "time_from_now": -1492487783.0, "type": "public", "id": "411486085871286", "name": "Kristin Larsen: Beyond Radburn: Why Clarence Stein Still Matters"}, {"category": "OTHER", "distance": 560.8906058274763, "stats": {"attending": 0, "noreply": 0, "declined": 0, "maybe": 0}, "description": "Students are invited to AAP's Architecture Career Forum 2017.

If you would like to discuss, make suggestions, volunteer, or get involved, please join our facebook group!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1875610586053668/\n\nOur official event will begin at 12pm with a rally at Bernie Milton Pavilion on the Ithaca Commons. The rally will feature science activities and presentations from local groups, students, and scientists, as well as discussions about how science impacts our everyday lives. We are also currently contacting city officials on both sides of the aisle who may be able to provide insights into how we can help advocate for science generally in the public sphere. Our event will conclude at 2pm, with a final address and ideas for how to continue science outreach beyond the march.\n\nFor individuals who wish to walk before our event, we UNOFFICIALLY (no road closures) suggest that individuals may want to check out the Sagan planet walk in reverse, starting at either Conley Park (Neptune) or Thompson Park (Uranus). A public map of the walk is available here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_Planet_Walk#/media/File:SaganWalk.Map.jpg, and participants can enjoy walking through the surrounding neighborhood en route to the obelisk for the Sun on the Ithaca Commons. Participants are also *unofficially* welcome to quietly walk the route after our event ends, in honor of the rich history of scientific exploration present in Ithaca and Central New York.\n\nWe wish to emphasise that this march is entirely non-partisan, and that everyone is welcome. While we understand the motivation to attend this protest is primarily political for many, the main focus of this rally is to support science and research and raise awareness of the importance of including verified, peer-reviewed data in the creation of new public policy.\n\nThis group is inclusive of all individuals who support science!\n\nTwitter: @ScienceMarchCNY", "start_time": "2017-04-22T12:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "The Downtown Ithaca Alliance welcomes you to Downtown Ithaca where you can shop, dine, work, and play.

We believe zines are a necessary medium for self-expression and social change, and we hope to foster a space where people can gather, collaborate, learn from each other, and make some awesome zines. \n\nTelluride House, in collab with Food Not Bombs Ithaca, is hosting a zinecrafting event and a distro. There'll be free zines, free supplies to make your own zines, and free food and coffee. Stop by anytime between noon and 5 p.m. on Sunday, April 16. Feel free to invite your friends, significant others, strangers, etc. \n\n>> What's a zine?\nIt's an independently or self-published booklet. People make zines as a way to express themselves, share radical ideas, connect with each other outside of commercial/mass-market means \u2014 and probably for a whole bunch of other reasons too. Zines (which is short for fanzine or magazine) generally have a circulation of a few hundred copies and is about basically any topic a zine-maker wants it to be, from lockpicking guides to prison abolition to feminist manifestos. \n\n>> What's a distro? \nNot to be confused with a disco, a distro is any place that distributes zines. \n\n>> How can I make a zine?\nPeople can make zines by physically cutting and gluing stuff onto sheets of paper and photocopying it or by formatting and printing pages on a computer. The pages are usually folded and stapled together. We'll have a photocopier on hand, as well as any other supply you might need to make a zine. You don't need a perfectly thought-out idea to make a zine, and people will be around to help brainstorm and flesh out ideas, as well as help get those ideas onto paper. \n\n>> How do I get to Telluride?\nTelluride is the brick building located across the street from Noyes Center. It's also directly below Gannet/Cornell Health. Please enter through the front door facing West Campus (take the stairs up to the porch). Message us if you have trouble finding it.\n\nJenny San Diego, in a zine called Not Sorry (April 2005, Portland): \n\"I'm not even trying to be dramatic, but to the world at large, I am a freak. My voice is downplayed, ignored and/or made into a joke in the mass of verbal and physical disapproval that bombards me every day when I leave the safety of my house or make the stupid decision to read a newspaper, magazine or turn the television on. When I am out of my element, I am told that my very existence is wrong or problematic because I am a fat, queer, mentally ill, politically radical woman with very little money and little to no regard for beauty standards and so on and so forth. But you know what? I am so NOT fucking SORRY. As long as myself and others are disrespected, invalidated, unsafe and ignored by the masses, my experiences, ideas and opinions need to be heard and I will keep on talking this shit and it is not going to be pretty. Besides, how else are these stories going to be documented? With the exception of the gay rights movement, these stories will most likely not be found in any future history books, and if they are, they will most likely be totally inaccurate. Now I know that this zine will not go much beyond the zine reading community, but this is where I have chosen to start and it's something which is always better than nothing.\"", "start_time": "2017-04-16T12:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "The Telluride House is a community of Cornell scholars passionate about intellectual engagement, democratic self-governance and communal living.", "name": "Telluride House", "id": "177591792688641", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/14717188_177593832688437_8341797532382573694_n.jpg?oh=192f6b8c8dbbcfe5900a439e5a5dd76a&oe=598064E7", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.487, "state": "NY", "street": "217 West Ave", "latitude": 42.44582}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14721589_177766986004455_2540624128189363661_n.jpg?oh=348831970e9659b50a02c573f8626e83&oe=5952114C", "emails": ["cbta.apply@tellurideassociation.org"]}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c159.0.200.200/p200x200/17884397_271720143275805_1262374727194903046_n.jpg?oh=3e4068a401198eaf3c3ae98fc009af83&oe=5997B51D", "end_time": "2017-04-16T17:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/17834840_271720143275805_1262374727194903046_o.jpg?oh=576510b6de56b8ef8ca84f1cb95cd699&oe=597C13A3", "time_from_now": -1492488054.0, "type": "public", "id": "1857872864437572", "name": "Zinecrafting & Distro"}, {"category": null, "distance": 374.27485348488733, "stats": {"attending": 141, "noreply": 933, "declined": 0, "maybe": 33}, "description": "This Saturday, April 15th, Cornell's Greek Tri-Council is hosting the Greek Community's largest day of service!

Joe's Italian and refreshments\n\nMore on the presentation:\nIt is often that correlation between cause and it's intended effect is made popular as being its cause. Causality and correlation are distinct and necessary, but not sufficient. The use of counterfactual design in experiments is only now getting eminence in the field of civil engineering - especially so in road construction. Counterfactual design, when implemented correctly can help reduce biases and provide a way forward to measure causality. Most government, especially those in developing countries have, in the past decade made allocations worth millions of dollars in road construction in their rural areas with the intention that road connection and access to transport medium leads to a reduction in poverty, increase in education and other socially desirable parameters. Federal governments, and international credit and lending institutions have studied the impact of such studies and made their conclusions - unless supplemented by secondary infrastructure, like access to markets, road development schemes seldom have any impact.

It\u2019s important to build relationships with people who can provide insight into your career field of interest, such as: what it is like to work in the field; the required skills/education/training; how one breaks into the industry; the qualities of people who are successfully in the field; and job prospects in the field/industry. \n\nEveryone already has a network. Family, friends, coaches, advisers, professors, current/former colleagues, etc. are all part of your network, but it\u2019s important to also include individuals who can share their career expertise and knowledge with you. \n\nAttend this session to learn how to expand your network. We will cover: strategies for identifying people you can add to your network; informational interviews (What are they? Why are they important?

But how does one come to be better than another?  Is moral decency a matter of grit or grace -- is the right training enough, or is innate talent also necessary? Since the Greeks, philosophers have proposed that moral functioning be understood as a skill, like making music or playing chess. Yet after 2,500 years, we are far from clear on what the acquisition of moral skill requires; what kind of practice, and what sort of talents, make people good?  In this abridged synthesis of what is known \u2013 and unknown -- in expert performance, human development, and moral philosophy, I take some hesitant steps towards articulating a \u201crecipe\u201d for moral improvement.\n\nJohn M. Doris is Professor in the Philosophy\u2013Neuroscience\u2013Psychology Program and Philosophy Department at Washington University in St. Louis and AY 2016-2017 Laurence S. Rockefeller Fellow, University Center for Human Values at Princeton University.  He works at the intersection of cognitive science, moral psychology, and philosophical ethics, and has published widely on these topics in both philosophy and psychology journals. Doris has been awarded fellowships from Michigan\u2019s Institute for the Humanities; Princeton\u2019s University Center for Human Values; the National Humanities Center; the American Council of Learned Societies; the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences; and the National Endowment for the Humanities; and is a winner of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology\u2019s Stanton Prize for excellence in interdisciplinary research.  He authored Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior (Cambridge, 2002) and Talking to Our Selves: Reflection, Ignorance, and Agency (Oxford, 2015). With his colleagues in the Moral Psychology Research Group, he wrote and edited The Moral Psychology Handbook (Oxford, 2010).  At Washington University, Doris\u2019 pedagogy has been recognized with an Outstanding Mentor Award from the Graduate Student Senate and the David Hadas Teaching Award for excellence in the instruction of first year undergraduates.", "start_time": "2017-04-12T12:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Research informing Practice.

He is the director of the Military Projects, assisting military family support programs in the Army, Army Reserve, and Department of Defense with needs assessment, program evaluation, and research studies of programs and services offered to service members and their families.\n\nMarney Thomas, Ph.D., is a senior extension associate and the former director of the Military Projects (1991-2009).\n\nThis talk is open to all.

The Symposium will take place on Friday, February 17, 2017, at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York.  Increasingly timely, this year\u2019s topic is \u201cNorth Korea: The Legal Frameworks in and around the Hermit Kingdom.\u201d \n\nNorth Korea, after being subject to a new UN resolution in December 2016, observes changing relationships with the international community.  In conjunction with the new U.S. administration, one can expect a new international policy approach towards the Hermit Kingdom.  Even with such dynamic potential, few researchers have had the occasion to gather and discuss the international law issues raised in/by the DPRK.  This is why we are proud to be hosting one of the first-ever concentrated discussions on legal problems in and around North Korea.\n\nThe event will consist of multiple presentations exploring different areas of law by academics and experts from around the world.  Subtopics pertaining to human rights include the trafficking of North Korean women, detention procedures for \u201cenemies of the state,\u201d and North Korean forced labor in the European Union.  Other presentations include topics such as U.S.\u2013Korean relations, and economic and trade sanctions on the State.\n\nIt is our hope to further the exchange of knowledge, to encourage learning, and to foster new professional relationships.  We would be delighted to count you among our attendees in this academic event.  \n\nFor more information on the day, please consult the attached documents or visit the CILJ\u2019s website at http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/ILJ/index.cfm.", "start_time": "2017-02-17T09:30:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "Founded in 1967, the Cornell International Law Journal (ILJ) is one of the oldest and most distinguished international law journals in the country.

This fluid, known as fracking fluid, typically contains a mixture of water, sand, and up to two percent chemical additives and is designed to create or enhance fractures in the formation, allowing natural gas and liquids to escape. While this method has been heralded by many as a key component in creating jobs and utilizing domestic energy reserves, the use of chemical additives has prompted concerns about water contamination. Although fewer than thirty individual compounds are typically used to stimulate one well, over one thousand chemicals have been disclosed as fracking additives and other remain unknown because they are protected as trade secrets. In practice, this means that the composition of fracking fluids can vary widely from site to site and may include unknown contaminants, making detection of these compounds a logistical challenge.  \nIn order to identify water quality impacts of fracking operations, broad detection methods that can be used to detect a wide range of fracking additives must be developed. Our research focuses on using state of the art environmental forensics to identify fracking additives in both fracking fluid and affiliated wastewaters from two natural gas wells from the Marcellus shale play. Thus far, this work has successfully identified biocides and surfactants, including several compounds not explicitly listed on disclosure forms for the research site. This method offers a reliable approach for detecting fracking additives and can be applied to identify possible environmental contamination.\n\nWe shall be serving Burritos from Moe's and beverages for all.", "start_time": "2017-02-23T17:00:00-0500", "venue": {"about": "Cornell University CEE GSA", "name": "Cornell University CEE GSA", "id": "345974462201530", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/13882377_877926472339657_4310298681847044590_n.png?oh=51887f01095ab889ff51beeae492b6f9&oe=59877A2E", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4850769, "state": "NY", "street": "527 College Ave", "latitude": 42.4432106}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/13913937_877926372339667_5601795693809545568_o.jpg?oh=f9ead53ec4b04def6ee38c46ba9be4fa&oe=59941D00", "emails": null}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.27.200.200/p200x200/16681656_1005549632910673_3128301684673075204_n.jpg?oh=5cb2ad873abc7c7452791a6fe4ede9fc&oe=59526264", "end_time": "2017-02-23T18:00:00-0500", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/16819037_1005549632910673_3128301684673075204_o.jpg?oh=90c59ad636d11ce0e22897ed13a875ff&oe=5953D70A", "time_from_now": -1492490202.0, "type": "public", "id": "663133920555177", "name": "GraSS Seminar: What's in Fracking Fluid?"}, {"category": "FUNDRAISER", "distance": 227.42843585773917, "stats": {"attending": 15, "noreply": 1, "declined": 0, "maybe": 8}, "description": "On Wednesday, June 8th members of local law enforcement will be carrying the \"Flame of Hope\" from Ithaca Police Department to Stewart Park to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics New York athletes, and the 2016 Special Olympics New York Summer Games. \n\nCelebrating its 30th Anniversary in New York, Torch Run\u00ae is a year-round, grassroots fundraising campaign by law enforcement agencies to benefit their local Special Olympics Program.

Mr. Martin is at the forefront of the effort to bring the voices of those directly impacted by mass incarceration into the criminal justice reform conversation. Hear about his goals to cut the U.S. correctional population in half by 2030, his organization's campaign to close Rikers Island Correctional Center, and how you can work on criminal justice reform next summer.\n\nGlenn E. Martin is the founder of JustLeadershipUSA (JLUSA), an organization dedicated to cutting the US correctional population in half by 2030. JLUSA empowers people most affected by incarceration to drive policy reform. Glenn is a national leader and criminal justice reform advocate who spent six years in NYS prisons. Prior to founding JLUSA, Glenn served for seven years as VP of Public Affairs at The Fortune Society, and six years as Co-Director of the National HIRE Network at the Legal Action Center. Glenn is co-founder of the Education from the Inside Out Coalition, a 2014 Echoing Green Fellow, a 2012 America\u2019s Leaders of Change National Urban Fellow, and a member of the governing boards of the College and Community Fellowship, Million Hoodies, and the California Partnership for Safe Communities. Glenn also serves on Governor Cuomo\u2019s Reentry and Reintegration Council, the advisory board of the Vera Institute\u2019s Public Health and Mass Incarceration Initiative, the National Network for Safe Communities, the Executive Session on Community Corrections at Harvard University, and the Global Advisory Council (GAC) of Cornerstone Capital Group.\n\nGlenn was named on the 2015 Root 100 list of most influential African Americans. In 2015, Glenn wrote an open letter to President Obama, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, after a visit as an invited guest to the White House when he was separated from his colleagues and given a special escort due to his criminal conviction. Glenn was later invited back to speak on a panel at the White House, getting the chance to meet with President Obama at an event focused on criminal justice reform. In 2016, Glenn was appointed to the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal  Justice and Incarceration Reform; at the invitation of New York State Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman to look at the possibility of closing Rikers Island.

Although current psychological research suggests that problems during this developmental period are often overstated, adolescent-parent relationships do go through significant transformations that pose challenges for the family. In her talk, Judith Smetana will discuss findings from an ongoing program of research focusing on normative changes in different aspects of adolescent-parent relationships, including conflict and disagreements between parents and teenagers, adolescents\u2019 disclosure, secrecy, and information management with parents, and adolescents\u2019 and parents\u2019 beliefs about parents\u2019 legitimate authority to make rules about adolescents\u2019 lives. She will describe research with American families from diverse backgrounds and families from different cultures and discuss the significance of these findings for adolescent development and family functioning.\n\nJudith Smetana is professor of psychology and Director of the Developmental Psychology Ph.D. program at the University of Rochester, where she has held the Frederica Warner Chair of Human Development. She obtained her B.A. with highest honors in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley, and her M.S. and Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. After completing a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan, she moved to the University of Rochester, where she has received several mentoring and leadership awards. Dr. Smetana\u2019s research focuses on adolescent-parent relationships and parenting in different ethnic and cultural contexts and on children\u2019s moral reasoning and behavior. She has published numerous articles and chapters on these topics. Her authored books include Adolescents, families, and social development: How children construct their worlds (2011), and several edited volumes, including the Handbook of Moral Development (2006, 2014), and Adolescent vulnerabilities and opportunities: Constructivist and developmental perspectives (2011).\n \n\nThis talk is open to all. Lunch will be served. Metered parking is available in the Nevin Welcome Center parking lot. No registration or RSVP required except for groups of 5 or more.

The description is as follows:\n\n\"New York launched the largest bike-sharing system in North America in May 2013. A group of us at Cornell have worked with Citibike, using analytics and optimization to change how they manage the system. Huge rush-hour usage imbalances the system; we answer the following questions: where should bikes be at the start of each day and how can we mitigate the imbalances that develop? We employ a combination of optimization methods and stochastic modeling to develop a suite of tools that address a number of related questions.\n\nThis is joint work primarily with Daniel Freund, Shane Henderson, and Eoin O'Mahony.\"\n\nDavid Shmoys is the Director of the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Co-Chair of the Academic Planning Committee for Cornell NYC Tech, and Associate Director of the Institute of Computational Sustainability at Cornell University. Shmoys' research has focused on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for discrete optimization problems, with applications including scheduling, inventory theory, computational biology, and most recently, comptuational sustainability. His work has highlighted the central role that linear programming plays in the design of approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems; his recent book, co-authored with David Williamson), The Design of Approximation Algorithms, was awarded the 2013 Lanchester Prize by INFORMS.", "start_time": "2017-04-20T17:30:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Data Science is a student run organization that seeks to prepare students for a career in data  science.", "name": "Cornell Data Science", "id": "387444998103667", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c6.0.200.200/p200x200/1964944_389888827859284_5171415626417991522_n.jpg?oh=660fd1b0344d4bc0cf4544f92c69d5dd&oe=5987BDC7", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.481194496155, "state": "NY", "street": "G01 Gates Hall, Cornell University", "latitude": 42.445073854318}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/17991504_731786337002863_6716870934814714729_o.png?oh=a0d9936a02a9cea07ef66f69c37c6c66&oe=594DF924", "emails": ["dk444@cornell.edu"]}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q87/c166.0.200.200/p200x200/17992206_731786137002883_1304290244134920110_n.jpg?oh=1f304dc61bc695dbf725e91f16123065&oe=598CEC40", "end_time": "2017-04-20T18:30:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q81/s720x720/17973706_731786137002883_1304290244134920110_o.jpg?oh=a574eb8edbd0d1f53d6ac9edeb8f2944&oe=5951869E", "time_from_now": -1492490429.0, "type": "public", "id": "1864704277116442", "name": "CDS Professor Talk Series - David Shmoys"}, {"category": "FUNDRAISER", "distance": 179.6274953930932, "stats": {"attending": 21, "noreply": 73, "declined": 0, "maybe": 19}, "description": "Back early from break?

Deep models require substantial amounts of memory, which limits their applicability for mobile and resource constrained devices.  I will introduce an approach to reduce model sizes dramatically through random weight sharing with hash functions. \n2. Neural networks become harder to train with increasing depth, in part because feature information and gradients vanish along the forward and backward propagation.  I will propose a method to randomly shrink networks during training time, while recovering their full depth in the test case.  This approach reduces the ill effects of deep architectures and significantly speeds up training time. \n3. Neural networks can easily be fooled by tiny, meaningless changes to inputs in order to produce arbitrary predictions.  We conjecture that this effect is due to samples leaving the underlying data manifold and we provide a new algorithm to approximately move inputs along this manifold.  This provides an elegant framework to induce class membership changes to inputs (rather than merely changing predictions) in a purely data driven manner.  It also sheds light onto the inner works of deep learning and provides helpful intuitions why convolutional networks are so successful for computer vision tasks.\"", "start_time": "2016-05-04T17:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Cornell Data Science is a student run organization that seeks to prepare students for a career in data  science.", "name": "Cornell Data Science", "id": "387444998103667", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c6.0.200.200/p200x200/1964944_389888827859284_5171415626417991522_n.jpg?oh=660fd1b0344d4bc0cf4544f92c69d5dd&oe=5987BDC7", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.481194496155, "state": "NY", "street": "G01 Gates Hall, Cornell University", "latitude": 42.445073854318}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/17991504_731786337002863_6716870934814714729_o.png?oh=a0d9936a02a9cea07ef66f69c37c6c66&oe=594DF924", "emails": ["dk444@cornell.edu"]}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c166.0.200.200/p200x200/13076747_561614850686680_3894675031614538833_n.png?oh=1707a12959eb7b1bc004037b84336565&oe=59941EB2", "end_time": "2016-05-04T18:00:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13076747_561614850686680_3894675031614538833_n.png?oh=9bac1dae36bd0ef69d3e4f99a7405cc5&oe=59516CFB", "time_from_now": -1492488345.0, "type": "public", "id": "1370579272967823", "name": "Deep(er) Learning with Random Connections"}, {"category": null, "distance": 213.05916112751467, "stats": {"attending": 9, "noreply": 287, "declined": 0, "maybe": 6}, "description": "STUDENTS!!!

These letters will be shown next year to incoming freshman and to the Cornell community as a way of keeping your memories alive. If you have a photo you would like to attach, or would like to type up a longer letter, we encourage you to email us.

The focus of the first story is, in a broad sense, on science and my research in computational mechanics, tribology and earthquake mechanics. I provide an overview of our research projects and present a few key findings. We discuss the challenges as well as the opportunities of developing computational models and using high-performance computing. The second story concerns society and is about me working as a young (at that time not yet fully educated) engineer on a major hydrologic problem of an underprivileged suburb of the capital of Senegal. I present the events that led to these (almost) yearly floods and illustrate the consequences for the local population. We discuss the hydro-socioeconomic complexity of this catastrophe, the need of a multi-disciplinary perspective/team, and our approach to a solution. In my third story, I talk about \u201cla Suisse\u201d, my home country. Going beyond the widely known signature features of Switzerland, we talk about the uniqueness of the management approach applied to govern this multi-lingual country and some other interesting aspects.", "start_time": "2017-04-14T16:30:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Cornell University CEE GSA", "name": "Cornell University CEE GSA", "id": "345974462201530", "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/13882377_877926472339657_4310298681847044590_n.png?oh=51887f01095ab889ff51beeae492b6f9&oe=59877A2E", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14853", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.4850769, "state": "NY", "street": "527 College Ave", "latitude": 42.4432106}, "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/13913937_877926372339667_5601795693809545568_o.jpg?oh=f9ead53ec4b04def6ee38c46ba9be4fa&oe=59941D00", "emails": null}, "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/c0.0.200.200/p200x200/17883660_1040873699378266_7194285613025818950_n.jpg?oh=4a2aed4dae7c4c865ef44f12d0127487&oe=598EE195", "end_time": "2017-04-14T17:30:00-0400", "cover_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/17814687_1040873699378266_7194285613025818950_o.jpg?oh=2321bf62219ebe6817c7645d83e962dd&oe=5996A32D", "time_from_now": -1492490420.0, "type": "public", "id": "1887038794888484", "name": "Science, Society \"et la Suisse\""}, {"category": "RELIGIOUS_EVENT", "distance": 187.70343526896576, "stats": {"attending": 4, "noreply": 71, "declined": 0, "maybe": 8}, "description": "Location: 145 McGraw Hall Ithaca, NY 14853\n\nCome listen to a talk by our Eid banquet speaker on her identity as a Latina Muslim revert.

Disruptive Innovation is a powerful organizational change theory that emerged in the private sector but is now being increasingly applied to social-sector organizations. In his talk Andy will present the results of his recently completed dissertation study which explored programmatic innovation in Cornell Cooperative Extension through the lens of Disruptive Innovation. The purpose of the study was to determine if there are common building blocks supporting and sustaining disruptive type innovation in Extension. The results of the study, and the potential implications for Cooperative Extension, will be explored and discussed.\n\nAndy Turner leads the New York State 4-H Youth Development program in the BCTR for Cornell Cooperative Extension. He joined the campus-based Extension leadership in 2012 after serving 23 years as a county educator and executive director. Advancing environmental education and sustainability, and applying a facilitative leadership style towards organizational change and innovation are two consistent themes throughout his career. Andy earned his bachelor's and master's from Cornell University and has just recently completed his Ed.D in executive leadership from St. John Fisher College.

The rationale behind these laws ranges from upholding French la\u00efcit\u00e9 to seeing burkini as symbolic of enslavement of Muslim women to concerns over national security and public order especially in the wake of recent terror attacks in France. Critics of the ban, however, have called the laws Islamophobic and misogynist, seeing it as a continuation of the French colonial \u2018civilizing mission\u2019 and highlighting the marginalization of the Muslim minority in France.\n\nJoin us to engage in an important conversation on security, gender and racism in the context of French secularism with three distinguished Cornell professors:\n\nPanelists:\n\nCamille Robcis is an Associate Professor in the History Department. Her research focuses on on three broad issues: the relationships among intellectuals, ideas, and politics; the historical construction of norms; and the articulation of universalism and difference in the context of modern France. She is the author of  The Law of Kinship: Anthropology, Psychoanalysis, and the Family in Twentieth-Century France (Cornell University Press, 2013) and has taught courses on modern European history, French history, intellectual history, historiography, gender and sexuality, psychoanalysis, contemporary critical theory, and European social and political thought.\n\nDurba Ghosh is an Associate Professor in the History Department. She has written extensively on gender, culture, law, archives, and colonial governance in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century India, and is interested in the importance of history in legitimizing anti-colonial struggles. She is the author of Sex and the Family in Colonial India: the making of empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) and her current research focuses on popular and radical political movements in early and mid-twentieth century India as well as the role of political violence in popular historical narratives.\n\nRichard Miller is a Professor in the Philosophy Department and Director of the Program on Ethics and Public Life. His main interest is social and political philosophy and he has authored several books including Globalizing Justice: The Ethics of Poverty and Power (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) and Moral Differences: Truth, Justice and Conscience in a World of Conflict (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992). His writing and teaching on social justice concern the moral significance of economic inequality, the nature and implications of democratic values and the proper political role of evaluations of ways of life; he addresses these issues in a book he is currently writing The Ethics of Social Democracy.\n\nModerator: Satya Mohanty is a Professor in the Department of English and his work is in literary and cultural theory.  He is a co-founder of the Future of Minority Studies (FMS) Research Project, the Global South Cultural Dialogue Project and the South Asian Vernacular Culture and Alternative Modernities Project and he is the coordinator of the Minority, Indigenous and Third World Studies Research group at Cornell. He is the author of Literary Theory and the Claims of History: Postmodernism, Objectivity, Multicultural Politics among other publications and co-editor of Identity Politics Reconsidered.\n\nCosponsored by: MITWSrg (Minority, Indigenous & Third World Studies), Cornell University Department of History, The Cornell Program on Ethics and Public Life, Cornell Asian Pacific Islander Student Union - CAPSU, Arab Student Association at Cornell.
