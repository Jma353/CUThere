To a blind person, they sound like a rave DJ mashing-up house beats with 60\u2032s folk lyrics. To the police, it\u2019s a busy day on the sidewalk.\n\nThe Primate Fiasco uses instruments that are loud without electricity, giving them the opportunity to attack at any moment, in any location, with or without permission. No one is safe, not even an elevator or city bus. If The Primate Fiasco sees a dull moment somewhere, they will pop out of the nearest sewer drain or trash can to lead an irresistible dance party.\n\nOn stage, the sound is different. This band has pioneered what is possible with mind-bending Accordion, funky pockets of a hyperactive Sousaphone player, and banjo that thinks it\u2019s a Fender Strat. Add lyrics that grab hold of even the most inattentive audience and beats that channel surf like a remote that\u2019s been sat on. The music is always high energy and extremely imaginative. Most importantly, this is fun. People smile from the first beat to the last smoldering ash of what was previously a dance floor.\n\nFollowing a Grammy-nominated kids album, several conquered jam and electronica fests and stolen hearts at prestigious folk festivals, the Primate Fiasco audience demographic is as diverse as a New York City street. No one is safe from the Fiasco. You will smile.\"\n\nTHE ITHACA BOTTOM BOYS have been turning heads in the local and regional scene recently due to several undeniably stellar shows at last years Grassroots Music Festival in Trumansburg, and at The Blind Spots welcome home show at The Haunt this past Saint Patricks Day. \n\nDelightfully disorienting in their designated \"genre\" the Bottom Boys do their best to keep their audiences engaged, loose, and wanting more. \n\nIt was only this past Saturday that the IBB came home from their first shows out of NYS. The week was packed with unforgettably formative experiences, where they were given new opportunities to refine their sound and stage show to new calibers.\n\nDOORS at 9PM, SHOW at 9:30\nCOVER $5", "start_time": "2017-04-06T21:00:00-0400", "venue": {"about": "Ithaca's own 250 capacity live music saloon venue. 2400 square feet with house stage/sound/backline on the Commons.\nFor booking:  booktherange@gmail.com", "name": "The Range", "emails": ["therangeithaca@gmail.com"], "profile_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/17155465_440619976313113_4275122384457243958_n.jpg?oh=9048760834ee2c175461fc89efebbc74&oe=596473A3", "location": {"city": "Ithaca", "zip": "14850", "country": "United States", "longitude": -76.49826, "state": "NY", "street": "119 E.

Come celeabrate with one of the best Grateful Dead cover bands around! Break out your colorful tie-dyes and spend the evening listening to cultural music that has withstood the test of time.\n\nBand Bio:\n\nGratefully Yours has quickly established itself as one of the Northeast\u2019s premiere Grateful Dead cover bands; with a truly all-star lineup and often performing \u201cdream\u201d set lists submitted by their fans. The band was founded in 2012 by Alex Mazur, (founding member and keyboardist of The Deadbeats\u2026 one of the, if not the longest running Grateful Dead cover bands in existence).  Along with a core lineup that includes, Adam Czolowski (Sonic Garden), Tom Pirozzi (Ominous Seapods), Jeff Martinson (Shakedown) and Rob Schiff (Nailed Shutt), other honored members include Vinnie Amico (moe.), Rob Eaton (Dark Star Orchestra), Russ Lawton (Trey Anastasio Band), Bill Carbone (Max Creek) and Zach Nugent (Cats Under The Stars).\nThe Dead were a truly unique band and had a unique bond with their audience:  Magic is what they did. Music was how they did it. Ultimately, it is that magic that Gratefully Yours aims to \u201ccover\u201d and pay tribute to. And taking it one step further, they also encourage their audience to participate further in the creative process by giving them the opportunity to submit their dream set lists (or vote for one) online and the band often chooses one to perform at their shows. But of course, you never know what might happen\u2026\n\n      St. Vith takes a modern impression on the 70's jam styles of bands such as the grateful dead. They are tuned to a intimate setting such as wineries and cafes, though they are not limited. Festivals and larger settings allow for a fuller spectrum of intensity and sound.
